===
acting
career
===
when
george
englund
decided
to
use
thailand
as
the
location
for
the
fictional
country
portrayed
in
his
film
the
ugly
american
,
kukrit
was
appointed
as
cultural
advisor
to
make
sure
the
film
accurately
portrayed
monarchy
in
a
buddhist
country.
englund
had
difficulty
casting
the
part
of
the
fictional
prime
minister
,
but
he
was
so
impressed
by
kukrit
's
cultural
refinement
and
mastery
of
english
that
he
offered
him
the
part
,
saying
,
``
i
ca
n't
think
of
anyone
who
could
play
it
better.
''
kukrit
accepted
,
saying
,
according
to
englund
,
``
we
are
all
actors
anyway
,
and
i
think
you
're
right
that
i
could
play
it
better
than
anyone.
''
probably
because
of
this
,
after
he
became
a
real-life
prime
minister
of
thailand
in
<year>
,
the
word
``
sarkhan
''
has
entered
the
thai
language
as
a
nickname
of
thailand
itself
,
often
with
a
slight
self-deprecating
or
mocking
tone.

his
ornithological
research
work
on
subantarctic
islands

for
his
circumnavigation
of
antarctica
in

was
conceived
as
a
circum-antarctic
voyage
to
study
the
seabirds
of
the
southern
ocean
in
order
to
further
their
conservation.
clark
spent
seven
years

the
most
significant
ornithological
work
was
carried
out
in

konstantinovich
belyayev
(
russian
:
дми́трий
константи́нович
беля́ев
,
<day>
–
<day>
)
was
a
soviet
geneticist
and
academician
who
served
as
director
of
the
institute
of
cytology
and
genetics
(
ic
&
g
)
of
the
ussr
academy
of
sciences
,
novosibirsk
,
from
<year>
to
<year>.
his
decades-long
effort
to
breed
domesticated
silver
foxes
was
described
by
the
new
york
times
as
“arguably
the
most
extraordinary
breeding
experiment
ever
conducted.”
a
<year>
article
in
scientific
american
stated
that
belyayev
“may
be
the
man
most
responsible
for
our
understanding
of
the
process
by
which
wolves
were
domesticated
into
our
canine
companions.”beginning
in
the
<year>s
,
in
order
to
uncover
the
genetic
basis
of
the
distinctive
behavioral
and
physiological
attributes
of
domesticated
animals
,
belyayev
and
his
team
spent
decades
breeding
the
silver
fox
(
vulpes
vulpes
)
and
selecting
for
reproduction
only
those
individuals
in
each
generation
that
showed
the
least
fear
of
humans.
after
several
generations
of
controlled
breeding
,
a
majority
of
the
silver
foxes
no
longer
showed
any
fear
of
humans
and
often
wagged
their
tails
and
licked
their
human
caretakers
to
show
affection.
they
also
began
to
display
spotted
coats
,
floppy
ears
,
curled
tails
,
as
well
as
other
physical
attributes
often
found
in
domesticated
animals
,
thus
confirming
belyayev’s
hypothesis
that
both
the
behavioral
and
physical
traits
of
domesticated
animals
could
be
traced
to
``
a
collection
of
genes
that
conferred
a
propensity
to
tameness—a
genotype
that
the
foxes
perhaps
shared
with
any
species
that
could
be
domesticated
''
.belyayev’s
experiments
were
the
result
of
a
politically
motivated
demotion
,
in
response
to
defying
the
now
discredited
non-mendellian
theories
of
lysenkoism
,
which
were
politically
accepted
in
the
soviet
union
at
the
time.
belyayev
has
since
been
vindicated
in
recent
years
by
major
scientific
journals
,
and
by
the
soviet
establishment
as
a
pioneering
figure
in
modern
genetics.
==
early
life
and
education
==
belyayev
was
born
on
<day>
,
in
protasovo
,
a
town
in
the
russian
province
of
kostroma.
he
was
his
family
's
fourth
and
youngest
son.
his
father
,
konstantin
pavlovich
,
was
a
priest.
his
brother
nikolai
,
who
was
<integer>
years
his
senior
,
was
a
prominent
geneticist
who
worked
with
sergei
chetverikov
(
<year>–<year>
)
,
a
pioneer
of
population
genetics.
''
it
was
his
brother
's
influence
that
caused
him
to
have
this
special
interest
in
genetics
''
,
belyayev
's
protégé
,
lyudmila
trut
,
later
said.
both
belyayev
brothers
were
darwinists
and
believers
in
mendelian
genetics.
at
the
time
belyayev
came
of
age
,
however
,
life
was
dangerous
in
the
soviet
union
for
geneticists
with
such
views
,
because
the
stalinist
regime
supported
the
scientific
theories
of
agronomist
trofim
lysenko
and
outlawed
research
inspired
by
the
rival
views
of
gregor
mendel.
as
trut
recalled
,
``
genetics
was
considered
fake
science.
''
indeed
,
under
the
rule
of
stalin
,
leading
geneticists
who
believed
in
darwinian
evolution
and
mendelian
genetics
were
considered
enemies
of
the
state.
several
of
them
were
sent
to
prison
,
and
at
least
one
,
nikolai
vavilov
,
was
sentenced
to
death
,
and
died
of
starvation
in
prison
in
<year>.
==
early
career
==
the
next
year
,
belyayev
graduated
from
the
ivanovo
agricultural
institute
and
began
working
in
the
department
of
fur
animal
breeding
at
the
central
research
laboratory
in
moscow
,
which
was
affiliated
with
the
ministry
of
foreign
trade.
in

he
was
conscripted
into
the
military
,
and
was
wounded
and
received
several
military
decorations.
he
then
resumed
work
at
the
laboratory.
despite
the
persecution
of
adherents
of
darwinism
and
mendelian
genetics
,
belyayev
wrote
a
dissertation
on
``
the
variation
and
inheritance
of
silver-colored
fur
in
silver-black
foxes
''
and
continued
to
hold
fast
to
his
belief
in
evolution
and
mendelian
genetics.
still
,
to
be
safe
,
he
disguised
his
genetics
research
as
studies
in
animal
physiology.
nonetheless
,
his
known
interest
in
genetics
led
in
<year>
to
his
dismissal
from
his
position
as
head
of
the
department
of
fur
animal
breeding.after
the
death
of
stalin
in
<year>

the
soviet
persecution
of
geneticists
began
to
ease.
from

belyayev
worked
for
the

domesticated

explored
whether
selection

been
the
process

,
by
recording
the

in
foxes
when
in
each

only
the
most
tame
foxes
were
allowed
to
breed.
many
of
the

became
both
tamer
and
more
dog-like
in
morphology
,
including
displaying
mottled
or
spotted
coloured
fur.in
<year>
,
an
international
research
team
questioned
some
of
the
conclusions
that
they
suggested
had
been
abusively
drawn
from
this
famous
experiment
(
sometimes
by
the
popular
culture

regarding
the

it
remains
``

impact
==
samuelson
is
considered
one
of
the
founders
of
neo-keynesian
economics
and
a
seminal
figure
in
the
development
of
neoclassical
economics.
in
awarding
him
the
nobel
memorial
prize
in
economic
sciences
the
committee
stated
:
more
than
any
other
contemporary
economist
,
samuelson
has
helped
to
raise
the
general
analytical
and
methodological
level
in
economic
science.
he
has
simply
rewritten
considerable
parts
of
economic
theory.
he
has
also
shown
the
fundamental
unity
of
both
the
problems
and
analytical
techniques
in
economics
,
partly
by
a
systematic
application
of
the
methodology
of
maximization
for
a
broad
set
of
problems.
this
means
that
samuelson
's
contributions
range
over
a
large
number
of
different
fields.
he
was
also
essential
in
creating
the
neoclassical
synthesis
,
which
ostensibly
incorporated
keynesian
and
neoclassical
principles
and
still
dominates
current
mainstream
economics.
in
<year>
,
samuelson
was
one
of
the
ten
nobel
prize–winning
economists
signing
the
economists
'
statement
opposing
the
bush
tax
cuts.
==
aphorisms
and
quotations
==
stanislaw
ulam
once
challenged
samuelson
to
name
one
theory
in
all
of
the
social
sciences
that
is
both
true
and
nontrivial.
several
years
later
,
samuelson
responded
with
david
ricardo
's
theory
of
comparative
advantage
:
``
that
it
is
logically
true
need
not
be
argued
before
a
mathematician
;
that
is
not
trivial
is
attested
by
the
thousands
of
important
and
intelligent
men
who
have
never
been
able
to
grasp
the
doctrine
for
themselves
or
to
believe
it
after
it
was
explained
to
them.
''
for
many
years
,
samuelson
wrote
a
column
for
newsweek.
one
article
included
samuelson
's
most
quoted
remark
and
a
favorite
economics
joke
:

that

,
commentators

is
an
understatement.

in

joked
that

===
foundations
of
economic
analysis
===
paul
samuelson
's
book
foundations
of
economic
analysis
(
<year>
)
is
considered
his
magnum
opus.
it
is
derived
from
his
doctoral
dissertation
,
and
was
inspired
by
the
classical
thermodynamic
methods.
the
book
proposes
to
:
examine
underlying
analogies
between
central
features
in
theoretical
and
applied
economics
and
study
how
operationally
meaningful
theorems
can
be
derived
with
a
small
number
of
analogous
methods
(
p.
<integer>
)
,
in
order
to
derive
``
a
general
theory
of
economic
theories
''
(
samuelson
,
<year>
,
p.
xxvi
)
.
the
book
showed
how
these
goals
could
be
parsimoniously
and
fruitfully
achieved
,
using
the
language
of
the
mathematics
applied
to
diverse
subfields
of
economics.
the
book
proposes
two
general
hypotheses
as
sufficient
for
its
purposes
:
maximizing
behavior
of
agents
(
including
consumers
as
to
utility
and
business
firms
as
to
profit
)
and
economic
systems
(
including
a
market
and
an
economy
)
in
stable
equilibrium.in
the
first
tenet
,
his
views
presented
the
idea
that
all
actors
,
whether
firms
or
consumers
,
are
striving
to
maximize
something.
they
could
be
attempting
to
maximize
profits
,
utility
,
or
wealth
,
but
it
did
not
matter
because
their
efforts
to
improve
their
well-being
would
provide
a
basic
model
for
all
actors
in
an
economic
system.
his
second
tenet
was
focused
on
providing
insight
on
the
workings
of
equilibrium
in
an
economy.
generally
in
a
market
,
supply
would
equal
demand.
however
,
he
urged
that
this
might
not
be
the
case
and
that
the
important
thing
to
look
at
was
a
system
's
natural
resting
point.
foundations
presents
the
question
of
how
an
equilibrium
would
react
when
it
is
moved
from
its
optimal
point.
samuelson
was
also
influential
in
providing
explanations
on
how
the
changes
in
certain
factors
can
affect
an
economic
system.
for
example
,
he
could
explain
the
economic
effect
of
changes
in
taxes
or
new
technologies.
in
the
course
of
analysis
,
comparative
statics
,
(
the
analysis
of
changes
in
equilibrium
of
the
system
that
result
from
a
parameter
change
of
the
system
)
is
formalized
and
clearly
stated.

written
in

and
the

,
it
helped
to
popularize
the
insights
of
john
maynard
keynes.
a
main
focus
was
how
to
avoid
,
or
at
least
mitigate
,
the
recurring
slumps
in
economic
activity.
samuelson
wrote
:
``
it
is
not

much
to
say
that
the
widespread
creation

dictatorships

the

this
reflected
the
concern
of
keynes
himself
with
the
economic
causes
of
war
and
the
importance
of
economic
policy
in
promoting

samuelson
's
textbook
was
a
watershed
in
introducing
a
serious
study
of
business
cycles
in
the
economics
curriculum.
it
was
particularly
timely
because
it
followed
the
great
depression
,
which
had
only
ended
because
of
the
fiscal
stimulus
of

the
study
of
business
cycles
along
with
the
introduction
of
the
keynesian
approach
of
aggregate
demand
set
the
stage
for

which
then
diffused
throughout
the

translations

attracted
many
imitators

david
cass
was
born
in
<year>
in
honolulu
,
hawaii.
he
earned
an
a.b.
in
economics
from
the
university
of
oregon
in
<year>
and
started
to
study
law
at
the
harvard
law
school
as
he
thought
of
becoming
a
lawyer
according
to
family
tradition.
as
he
hated
studying
law
he
left
the
program
after
one
year
and
served
in
the
army
from
<year>

he
then
entered
the
economics
ph.d.
program
at
stanford
university.
here
he
met
karl
shell
,
although
the
two
began
to
work
together
only
after
both
graduated.
cass
's
doctoral
advisor
was
hirofumi
uzawa
,
who
also
introduced
him
to
tjalling
koopmans
,
who
at
that
time
was
a

during
his
time
at
yale
university
he
collaborated
with
menahem
yaari
and
joseph

and
worked
mostly
on
overlapping
generations
models.
in

he
left
new

for
carnegie-mellon
university
in
pittsburgh
,
where
he
was
a

==
research
==
cass
made
important
contributions
to
pure
economic
theory
,
mostly
in
the
field
of
general
equilibrium
theory.
he
made
major
contributions
to
the
theory
of
optimal
growth
,
the
theory
of
sunspots
and
the
theory
of
incomplete
markets.
he
is
perhaps
best
known
for
his
article
“optimum
growth
in
an
aggregative
model
of
capital
accumulation”
,
which
was
a
part
of
his
dissertation.
in
this
paper
he
proves
a
necessary
and
sufficient
condition
for
efficiency
in
the
neoclassical
growth
model
first
introduced
by
frank
ramsey.
a
major
difference
to
the
standard
ramsey
growth
model
was
that
cass
considered
the
case
where
consumption
in
future
periods
is
discounted
,
thus
implicitly
assuming
that
consumers
prefer
consumption
today
to
consumption
tomorrow.
this
modified
version
of
the
ramsey
growth
model
is
also
known
as
the
ramsey-cass-koopmans
model
,
named
after
frank
ramsey
,
david
cass
and
tjalling
koopmans.he
was
also
famous
for
the
``
cass
criterion
''
for
overlapping
generations
models
and
in
the
neoclassical
growth
model
,
and
his
work
,
together
with
karl
shell
,
on
the
influence
of
extrinsic
uncertainty
on
economic
equilibria
,
also
known
as
the
concept
of
sunspot
equilibria
or
the
theory
of
sunspots.
together
with
joseph
stiglitz
he
proved
conditions
under
which
it
is
possible
for
an
investor
to
achieve
an
optimal
portfolio
under
the
restriction
of
being
able
to
buy
only
two
mutual
funds.
they
also
showed
that
generally
the
demand
for
money
can
not
be
derived
from
portfolio
theory.
cass
was
also
a
major
contributor
to
the
theory
of
incomplete
markets
,
the
turnpike
theory
and
theory
of
economies
with
markets
that
repeatedly
open
over
time.
===
cass
's
scientific
works
===
dave
cass
's
first
major
contribution
to
economics
was
the
characterization
of
optimal
growth
trajectories
in
his
thesis
work
under
hirofumi
uzawa’s
supervision
at
stanford
university.
the
celebrated
cass
criterion
for
optimal
time
paths
in
the
one
good
growth
model
quickly
followed.
the
essence
of
this
work
is
the
search
for
price
characterizations
of
efficiency
for
dynamic
time
paths
,
an
effort
that
directly
pointed
the
way
to
the
subsequent
full
dynamic
decentralization
of
the
neoclassical
optimal
growth
model
,
a
fact
that
permits
its
use
for
modeling
a
wide
range
of
business
cycle
and
other
macroeconomic
phenomena.
accordingly
,
cass
is
rightly
honored
,
together
with
tjalling
koopmans
and
frank
ramsey
,
as
one
of
the
fathers
of
dynamic
macroeconomic
analysis.
the
original
papers
from
cass
's
thesis
were
•
''
optimum

in
an
aggregative
model
of
capital
accumulation
,
''
published
in
the
review
of

:
a

,
''
published
in
econometrica
in
<year>the
``
optimum
growth
...
''
paper
was
the
culmination
of
a
long
line
of
research
(
beginning
with
frank
ramsey
's
pioneering
research
in
the
<year>s
)
on
modeling
economic
growth.
the
literature
found
expression
in
the
post-war
period
in
the
work
of
robert
solow
at
mit
and
hirofumi
uzawa
at
stanford
,
not
only
as
a
theory
of
growth
,
but
also
as
a
tool
for
understanding
the
macroeconomy.
much
of
the
development
of
the
models
in
the
literature
was
grounded
in
a
set
of
post-war
``
stylized
facts
''
that
every
economics
ph.d.
student
learns
in
their
first
year
of
graduate
study.
one
of
the
weak
links
in
the
development
of
these
early
models
was
their
specification
of
saving
behavior
as
being
exogenous
and
given
by
the
empirical
regularity
of
the
consumption-income
relationship
,
and
the
various
(
partial
equilibrium
)
theories
of
consumption
spending
designed
to
explain
this
regularity.
cass
's
paper
was
the
first
to
endogenize
the
consumption-savings
decision
by
deriving
an
optimal
capital
accumulation
trajectory
that
maximized
the
discounted
sum
of
utility
payoffs
over
time.
the
tools
that
cass
used
to
derive
his
results
were
from
the
then-newly
developed
field
of
optimal
control
in
mathematics
pioneered
by
lev
pontryagin.
the
main
results
in
the
paper
are
a
demonstration
that
under
now-standard
assumptions
on
preferences
and
technology
,
the
optimal
accumulation
sequence
exists
and
is
unique.
the
other
papers
in
cass
's
thesis
drew
on
the
major
insights
of
the
``
optimum
growth
...
''
paper
by
extending
them
to
show
the
existence
of
an
optimal
growth
trajectory
in
a
two-sector
model
of
capital
accumulation
,
and
the
existence
of
a
so-called
turnpike
growth
path
associated
with
the
optimal
capital
accumulation
trajectory
in
the
one-sector
model.
these
papers
were
published
(
possibly
even
completed
)
while
cass
was
a
research
staff
member
and
then
an
assistant
professor
at
the
cowles
foundation
at
yale
university
(
<year>–<year>
)
.
cass
was
promoted
to
untenured
associate
professor
at
cowles
and
remained
at
yale
until
<year>.
he
coauthored
several
more
papers
during
this
time
with
joseph
stiglitz
and
menahem
yaari
,
who
were
also
at
yale
during
this
period.

<integer>–<integer>
(
<year>
)
.in
the
spear
and
wright
macroeconomic
dynamics
interview
with
cass
,
he
indicates
that
his
work
with
manny
yaari
at
yale
constituted
his
introduction
to
samuelson
's
consumption
loans
(
now
overlapping
generations
)
model
,
which
would
come
front
and
center
as
a
major
workhorse
model
in
cass
's
subsequent
work
with
karl
shell
on
sunspot
equilibria.
during
this
time
,
cass
also
looked
more
deeply
at
the
question
of
how
individual
saving
behavior
and
efficient
growth
were
related.
the
paper
on
present
values
as
efficiency
prices
that
cass
co-authored
with
yaari
is
easily
seen
to
be
a
precursor
of
his
subsequent
work
at
carnegie
mellon
on
capital
overaccumulation
and
efficiency
which
led
to
the
famous
cass
criterion
for
determining
inefficiency.
finally
,
cass
's
work
with
stiglitz
on
modeling
investor
preferences
and
asset
returns
provided
a
foundation
for
his
later
work
on
financial
general
equilibrium.
cass
left
yale
in
<year>
,
describing
himself
as
part
of
yale
's
``
junior
through-put.
''
he
was
recruited
by
dick
cyert
,
then
dean
of
the
graduate
school
of
industrial
administration
at
carnegie
mellon
university.
during
his
time
at
gsia
,
cass
completed
the
work
on
capital
overaccumulation
,
continued
his
work
with
joe
stiglitz
on
asset
pricing
,
and
began
work
exploring
the
general
applicability
of
the
mathematical
techniques
he
had
used
in
his
thesis
(
mathematical

the

.while
the
last
two
papers
were
published
after
cass
left
gsia
,
he
indicates
in
the
interview
that
he
began
this
work
while
he
was
still
at
carnegie
mellon.
cass’s
second
seminal
contribution—the
notion
of
a
so-called
sunspot
equilibrium
in
dynamic
economies
which
he
developed
jointly
with
karl
shell—is
also
the
stuff
of
legend
,
and
grew
out
of
his
long
and
productive
collaboration
with
karl
at
penn.
the
early
impetus
for
cass’s
interest
in
this
topic
stemmed
from
work
he
did
with
manny
yaari
on
overlapping
generations
models
,
and
from
his
early
acquaintance
with
bob
lucas
at
carnegie
mellon
and
lucas’s
seminal
work
on
rational
expectations
in
dynamic
economic
models.
to
quote
from
the
spear-wright
interview
,
i
wasn’t
so
interested
in
macro
,
but
what
struck
me
,
and
this
is
related
to
some
of
my
later
work
,
was
the
assumption
that
[
lucas
]
made
to
solve
for
equilibrium
,
that
the
state
variables
were
obvious
...
bob
and
i
had
some
long
discussions
,
and
i
would
say
,
“well
bob
,
why
is
this
the
actual
state
space
in
this
model
?
”
that
question
came
up
...
after
i
came
to
penn.
at
some
point
karl
[
shell
]
and
i
started
talking
about
that
and
we
developed
what
we
called
the
idea
of
sunspots.the
key
paper
that
came
out
of
cass
's
and
karl
's
discussions
was
the
``
do
sunspots
matter
?
''
paper
published
in
the
journal
of

economy
in
<year>.
much
of
the
work
leading
up
to
this
paper
focused
on
the
overlapping

model
:
•
''

.the
first
actual
model
of
sunspot
equilibrium
was
produced
by
shell
in
an
olg
framework
with
linear
utility
functions
,
which
appeared
in
his
``
monnai
et
allocation
intertemporelle
''
in
<year>
,
as
part
of
the
malinvaud
lecture
series
in
paris
(
now
published
as
a
vintage
paper
in
macroeconomic
dynamics
)
.
cass
and
shell
's
jpe
paper
presented
a
simplified
,
two-period
dynamic
model
in
which
one
of
two
sets
of
agents
could
trade
assets
contingent
on
prices
in
the
second
period
,
while
the
second
set
of
agents
could
only
trade
on
the
second
period
spot
markets.
this
captured
the
friction
of
restricted
participation
present
in
olg
economies
,
where
some
agents
(
the
newly
entering
young
)
are
born
into
a
specific
state
and
can
not
insure
themselves
against
outcomes
in
the
birth
state.
the
paper
demonstrated
that
in
static
arrow-debreu
economies
with
complete
markets
,
extrinsic
uncertainty
(
where
no
fundamentals
of
the
model
are
stochastic
)
can
not
matter
to
equilibrium
allocations.
they
then
showed
that
when
some
agents
were
restricted
in
their
trades
,
so
that
market
completeness
was
violated
,
sunspots
could
matter
,
i.e.
there
could
exist
rational
expectations
equilibria
in
which
equilibrium
prices
depended
on
the
realization
of
an
extrinsic
stochastic
process.
in
passing
,
they
made
the
observation
that
since
the
validity
of
the
first
welfare
theorem
implied
that
there
could
be
no
sunspot
equilibria
,
a
necessary
condition
for
the
existence
of
such
equilibria
was
a
violation
of
the
conditions
under
which
the
first
welfare
theorem
holds.
this
observation
took
on
a
life
of
its
own
as
what
shell
called
the
philadelphia
pholk
theorem
:
if
the
first
welfare
theorem
does
n't
hold
,
then
you
can
find
an
economy
where
sunspots
matter.
in
addition
to
raising
troubling
questions
about
what
the
right
state
space
was
for
dynamic
stochastic
economies
,
the
notion
of
sunspot
equilibrium
raised
a
number
of
deep
questions
about
the
overall
determinacy
of
economic
equilibria
and
the
role
of
the
welfare
theorems
in
the
occurrence
or
non-occurrence
of
sunspot
equilibria.
these
questions
spawned
a
large
literature
on
determinacy
in
dynamic
economies
in
which
the
welfare
theorems
broke
down.
these
include
overlapping
generations
models
,
growth
models
with
externalities
or
taxes
,
and
models
in
which
asset
markets
were
incomplete.
all
were
shown
to
allow
the
existence
of
sunspot
equilibria.
and
,
in
a
suitable
twist
of
intellectual
fate
,
macroeconomists
have
recently
begun
to
explore
the
question
of
whether
sunspot
expectations
can
provide
a
more
plausible
source
of
fluctuations
in
dynamic
equilibrium
models
than
the
conventional
aggregate
productivity
disturbances.
cass’s
third
major
contribution
to
economic
theory
was
his
work
on
general
equilibrium
with
incomplete
markets
,
work
which
grew
out
of
his
exploration
of
the
question
of
existence
of
sunspot
equilibria
in
models
with
incomplete
asset
markets.
cass’s
follow-on
work
on
existence
and
determinacy
of
general
equilibrium
in
models
with
incomplete
asset
markets
spawned
another
large
literature
which
has
come
to
be
known
simply
as
gei.
as
an
historical
note
,
cass
never
really
liked
this
terminology
,
preferring
instead
to
think
of
these
models
as
ones
of
general
financial
equilibrium
(
gfe
)
to
emphasize
the
presence
of
financial
assets
and
the
frictions
these
introduced.
the
earliest
work
on
market
incompleteness
goes
back
to
arrow
in
the
<year>s
,
diamond
in
the
mid-‘<integer>’s
and
a
number
of
related
papers
in
the
finance
literature
between
the
late
<year>s
and
early
‘<integer>’s
(
geanakoplos
provides
an
excellent
survey
of
this
literature
)
.
the
canonical
gei
model
was
formulated
by
radner
in
the
early
<year>s
in
a
paper
which
also
pointed
up
one
of
the
fundamental
puzzles
about
models
with
incomplete
markets
:
the
possible
loss
of
dimensionality
in
the
span
of
the
asset
payoffs
as
prices
vary.
this
potential
for
non-existence
of
equilibrium
(
which
was
formally
developed
in
hart’s
counterexamples
to
existence
of
equilibrium
)
left
the
literature
in
limbo
for
almost
a
decade
,
until
cass’s
work
on
existence
in
economies
with
purely
financial
assets
pointed
the
way
out.
as
geanakoplos
notes
suddenly
in
the
middle
<year>s
the
pure
theory
of
gei
fell
into
place.
in
two
provocative
and
influential
papers
,
cass
showed
that
the
existence
of
equilibrium
could
be
guaranteed
if
all
the
assets
promise
delivery
in
fiat
money
,
and
he
gave
an
example
showing
that
with
such
financial
assets
there
could
be
a
multiplicity
of
equilibrium.
almost
simultaneously
werner
also
gave
a
proof
of
existence
of
equilibrium
with
financial
assets
,
and
geanakoplos
and
polemarchakis
showed
the
same
for
economies
with
real
assets
that
promise
delivery
in
the
same
consumption
good.the
first
paper
that
geanakoplos
references
above
appeared
initially
in
april
<year>
as
a
caress
working
paper.
this
work
was
followed
very
quickly
by
results
showing
that
the
non-existence
problem
pointed
out
by
hart
was
not
generic
,
and
led
ultimately
to
the
generic
existence
results
of
duffie
and
shafer
,
and
again
spawned
a
new
literature
looking
positively
at
the
welfare
implication
of
market
incompleteness
,
and
normatively
at
issues
of
asset
engineering.
in
the
time
after
this
seminal
work
in
gei
,
cass
's
various
papers
dealt
with
issues
of
determinacy
of
equilibrium
(
and
the
closely
related
issue
of
existence
of
sunspot
equilibria
)
,
and
with
the
optimality
of
allocations
in
the
presence
of
sunspots
and
incomplete
asset
markets.

to
round
out
this
summary
of
cass
's
work
,
despite
the
very
strong
evolution
of
his
ideas
from
his
initial
work
on
optimal
growth
,
to
the
work
on
sunspots
and
finally
on
market
incompleteness
,
cass
continued
to
be
interested
in
his
older
interests
when
he
saw
opportunities
for
contributions.
thus
,
his
<year>
paper
with
mukul
majumdar
,
``

allocation
,
consumption-value
maximization
and

tappan
mitra
,
``

''
hearken
back
to
his
earlier
work
on
capital
theory.
similarly
,

<year>
paper

chichilnisky
and

,
``

,
``

(

hearkens
back
to
his
original
work
on
asset

models
with
joe
stiglitz.
cass
's
last
published
paper
was
``
compatible
beliefs
and
equilibrium
''
(
<year>
,
j.
math.
econ.
<integer>
,
<integer>–<integer>
)
cass
describes
this
paper
as
a
concept
paper
,
in
which
he
goes
back
to
the
primitives
of
economic
theory
and
asks
what
beliefs
economic
agents
must
hold
in
order
to
justify
the
conventional
assumption
of
competitive
equilibrium.
cass
's
last
paper
,
``
utility-based
utility
''
was
under
revision
at
the
time
of
his
death.
this
paper
is
also
conceptual
in
nature
in
showing
that
sunspot
equilibria
could
exist
under
weaker
specifications
of
preferences
than
the
standard
von
neumann-morgenstern
specification.
==
personal
life
==
david
cass
was
outspoken
about
academic
and
personal
freedom.
in
<year>
he
became
involved
in
an
administrative
dispute
with
the
university
of
pennsylvania
over
the
implications
of
a
consensual
faculty-student
relationship.
at
this
time
he
had
a
consensual
relationship
with
a
then-graduate
student.
when
a
university
policy
on
faculty-student
relationships
was
adopted
cass
was
denied
the
appointment
as
chair
of
the
graduate
program
of
the
department
of
economics
because
of
this
relationship.
as
the
graduate
student
in
question
graduated
before
the
planned
appointment
of
cass
as
chair
of
the
department
,
the
timeline
of
the
administrative
action
rendered
the
initial
objection
moot.

hans
willi
hennig
(
<day>
–
<day>
)
was
a
german
biologist
who
is
considered
the
founder
of
phylogenetic
systematics
,
also
known
as
cladistics.
in
<year>
as
a
prisoner
of
war
,
hennig
began
work
on
his
theory
of
cladistics
,
which
he
published
in
german
in
<year>
,
with
a
substantially
revised
english
translation
published
in
<year>.
with
his
works
on
evolution
and
systematics
he
revolutionised
the
view
of
the
natural
order
of
beings.
as
a
taxonomist
,
he
specialised
in
dipterans
(
true
flies
)
.
hennig
coined
the
key
terms
synapomorphy
,
symplesiomorphy
and
paraphyly.
he
also
asserted
,
in
his
``
auxiliary
principle
''
,
that
``
the
presence
of
apomorphous
characters
in
different
species
'is
always
reason
for
suspecting
kinship
[
i.e.
,
that
species
belong
to
a
monophyletic
group
]
,
and
that
their
origin
by
convergence
should
not
be
presumed
a
priori
'
(
hennig
,
<year>
)
.
this
was
based
on
the
conviction
that
'phylogenetic
systematics
would
lose
all
ground
on
which
it
stands
'
if
the
presence
of
apomorphous
characters
in
different
species
were
considered
first
of
all
as
convergences
(
or
parallelisms
)
,
with
proof
to
the
contrary
required
in
each
case.
''
this
has
been
viewed
as
an
application
of
the
parsimony
principle
to
the
interpretation
of
characters
,
an
important
component
of
phylogenetic
inference.he
is
also
remembered
for
hennig
's
progression
rule
in
cladistics
,
which
argues
controversially
that
the
most
primitive
species
are
found
in
the
earliest
,
central
part
of
a
group
's
area.

)
as
part
of
his
school
work
,
published
posthumously

it
showed
his
interest
as
well
as
his
deliberate
treatment
of
systematic
problems.

there
,
he
met
the
curator

germany
for
having
a
jewish
mother
and
wife.hennig
developed
a
deep
friendship
with
emden
's
successor
,
klaus
günther.
hennig
concluded
his
studies
with
a
dissertation
entitled
,
beiträge
zur
kenntnis
des
kopulationsapparates
der
cyclorrhaphen
dipteren.
by
this
time
,
hennig
had
published
eight
scientific
papers.
besides
his
<integer>-page
revision
of
the
tylidae
(
now
classed
as
micropezidae
)
,
there
were
further
papers
on
diptera
and
the
agamid
genus
draco

after
his
studies
,
hennig
was
volontär

===
as
a
military
entomologist
===
willi
hennig
was
drafted
in
<year>
to
train
for
the
infantry
and
concluded
this
course
in
<year>.
as
of
the
start
of
world
war
ii
,
he
was
deployed
in
the
infantry
in
poland
,
france
,
denmark
and
russia.
he
was
injured
by
grenade
shrapnel
in
<year>
and
was
subsequently
used
as
entomologist
at
the
institute
for
tropical
medicine
and
hygiene
in
berlin
,
carrying
the
rank
of
a
sonderführer
(

through
his
active
participation
in
war
as
soldier
and
scientist
hennig

later
subjected
to
accusations
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
national
socialist
party
,
especially
by
the
italian
biologist
and
founder
of
panbiogeography
,
leon
croizat.
no
evidence
has
been
officially
presented
to
support
the
claim.
there
is
no
report
of
hennig
supporting
the
national
socialist
party
views
publicly
on
any
occasion.
hennig
did
believe
that
nazi
germany
would
win
world
war
ii.during
his
time
as
prisoner
of
war
,
hennig
began
to
draft
his
most
important
contribution
to
systematics
,
not
published
until
<year>.
the
rough
draft
was
composed
with
pencil
and
ballpoint
pen
into
an

exercise
book
,
spanning
<integer>

during
the
war
,
he
also

supervisor
paul
buchner
as
assistant
to
professor
friedrich
hempelmann
at
the
university
of
leipzig
,
giving
lectures
in
general
biology
,
zoology
and
special
zoology
of
insects.
he
returned
to
the
german
entomological
institute
in
berlin
on
<day>
and
gave
up
his
position
in
leipzig.
from
<day>
he
led
the
section
for
systematic
entomology
and
was
second
director
of
the
institute.
on
<day>
he
habilitated
in
zoology
at
the
brandenburgische
landeshochschule
in
potsdam.
on
<integer>
october
that
year
he
was
offered
a
professorship
with
teaching
responsibilities
,
which
he
fulfilled
lecturing
on
special
zoology
of
invertebrates
,
systematic
zoology
and
taxonomic
practicals.
in
the
same
year
,
he
published
his
basic
outline
of
a
theory
of
phylogenetic
systematics
,
and
further
works
on
the
methodology
of
phylogenetic
systematics
followed
in
the
ensuing
years
,
accompanied
by
numerous
taxonomic
works
about
diptera.
his
two-volume
pocket
book
of
zoology
,
in
which
he
applied
phylogenetic
systematics
to
invertebrates
for
the
first
time
,
was
particularly
successful.
he
continued
working
at
the
german
entomological
institute
in
the
soviet
sector
of
berlin
,
berlin-friedrichshagen
,
all
the
while
living
in
the
american
sector
in
berlin-steglitz.
on
a
trip
to
france
with
his
son
on
<day>
he
heard
of
the
impending
berlin
wall
and
returned
to
berlin
immediately
to
quit
his
appointment.
moving
to
east
berlin
was
out
of
the
question
,
as
hennig
held
anti-communist
views
and
already
had
a
troubled
relationship
with
the
sozialistische
einheitspartei
deutschlands
(
socialist
unity
party
of
germany
,
sed
)
that
was
the
ruling
political
party
of
east
germany
,
as
hennig
had
repeatedly
helped
employees
of
the
institute
gain
employment
in
the
west.
===
<year>
to
<year>
===
in
west
berlin
,
hennig
was
given
an
interim
post
at
the
technische
universität
berlin
as
distinguished
professor.
he
rejected
offers
from
the
u.s.
department
of
agriculture
in
washington
,
d.c.
and
an
offer
made
by
his
friend
elmo
hardy
,
to
become
a
research
fellow
at
the
university
of
hawaii
in
honolulu
,
citing
as
reasons
that
the
education
of
his
sons
took
priority
for
him
,
and
that
he
needed
to
have
the
``
cultural
witnesses
of
the
antique
greek-roman
europe
within
ready
access
''
.
he
instead
decided
on
a
post
at
the
state
museum
of
natural
history
in
stuttgart
,
where
he
was
given
a
department
for
phylogenetic
research.
in
april
<year>
,
he
moved
to
ludwigsburg-pflugfelden
for
this
position.
the
scientific
collections
of

had
been
provisorily
kept
in
ludwigsburg

remained
here
until

dealt
almost
exclusively
with
taxonomic
revisions
of
dipterans.

beginning

as
economic
historian
kindleberger
used
a
narrative
approach
to
knowledge
and
not
based
on
mathematical
models
to
prove
his
point.
in
the
preface
to
the
great
depression
<year>-<year>
,
he
wrote
``
it

the
story
simply
told

===
hegemonic
stability
theory
===
in
his
<year>
and
<year>
book
the
world
in
depression
<year>–<year>
,
kindleberger
advances
an
idiosyncratic
,
internationalist
view
of
the
causes
and
nature
of
the
great
depression
,
that
concludes
that
a
world
hegemon
is
necessary
for
a
generally
stable
world
economy.
blaming
the
peculiar
length
and
depth
of
the
depression
on
the
hesitancy
of
the
us
in
taking
over
leadership
of
the
world
economy
when
britain
was
no
longer
up
to
the
role
after
world
war
i
,
he
concludes
that
``
for
the
world
economy
to
be
stabilized
,
there
has
to
be
a
stabilizer—one
stabilizer
''
,
by
which
,
in
the
context
of
the
interwar
years
at
least
,
he
means
the
united
states.
in
the
last
chapter
,
``
an
explanation
of
the
<year>
depression
''
,
kindleberger
lists
the
five
responsibilities
the
us
would
have
had
to
assume
in
order
to
stabilize
the
world
economy
:
maintaining
a
relatively
open
market
for
distress
goods
;
providing
countercyclical
,
or
at
least
stable
,
long-term
,
lending
;
policing
the
relative
stability
of
exchange
rates
;
ensuring
the
coordination
of
nations
'
macroeconomic
policies
;
acting
as
a
lender
of
last
resort
by
discounting
,
or
otherwise
providing
liquidity
,
in
a
financial
crisis.kindleberger
was
highly
skeptical
of
milton
friedman
and
anna
schwartz
's
monetarist
view
of
the
causes
of
the
depression
,
seeing
it
as
too
narrow
and
perhaps
dogmatic
,
and
dismisses
out
of
hand
what
he
characterized
as
paul
samuelson
's
``
accidental
''
or
``
fortuitous
''
interpretation.
the
world
in
depression
was
praised
by
john
kenneth
galbraith
as
'the
best
book
on
the
subject'.
for
kindleberger
,
the
main
problem
with
international
institutions
is
that
they
provide
public
goods
whose
provision
states
are
incentivized
to
free-ride
on.
following
mancur
olson
,
kindleberger
argued
that
the
solution
to
the
free-riding
problem
was
to
have
an
actor
who
was
large
enough
(
a
hegemon
)
and
willing
to
bear
the
cost
of
cooperation
alone.

==
contribution
to
continuum
mechanics
==
naghdi
's
work
on
continuum
mechanics
extended
over
a
period
of
more
than
forty
years
and
encompassed
almost
all
aspects
of
the
mechanical
behavior
of
solids
and
fluids.
a
consummate
theoretician
,
he
was
most
strongly
attracted
by
fundamental
questions
in
mechanics
,
and
always
sought
to
treat
these
at
the
highest
level
of
generality.
his
work
is
marked
by
a
penetrating
physical
intuition
combined
with
a
methodical
and
mathematical
line
of
thought.
he
is
best
known
for
his
research
in
the
areas
of
shell
theory
and
plasticity
,
but
is
also
recognized
for
his
contributions
to
linear
and
nonlinear
elasticity
,
viscoelasticity
,
the
theory
of
deformable
rods
,
the
theories
of
fluid
sheets
and
jets
,
thermomechanics
,
mixture
theory
,
and
general
continuum
mechanics.
naghdi
's
interest
in
elastic
shells
and
plates
dated
back
to
his
graduate
student
days
at
the
university
of
michigan
,
where
he
attended
summer
lectures
in
<year>
on
elastic
plates
by
stephen
timoshenko.
working
along
classical
lines
,
naghdi
subsequently
developed
a
systematic
treatment
of
elastic
shells
and
plates
undergoing
small
deformations
,
which
was
published
in
<year>.
during
the
<year>s
,
the
modern
renaissance
in
continuum
mechanics
was
gathering
momentum.
it
had
started
out
in
the
<year>s
as
an
interest
in
nonlinear
elastic
materials
and
non-newtonian
fluids
,
but
quickly
spread
to
envelop
a
much
broader
range
of
material
behavior.
naghdi
embraced
the
emerging
theoretical
developments
and
began
to
consider
in
a
new
light
the
mechanics
that
he
had
learned
from
classical
authors
such
as
love
,
lame
,
and
whittaker.
as
regards
shell
theory
,
he
soon
realized
that
a
completely
new
viewpoint
could
be
taken
which
would
lead
to
an
essential
clarification
of
the
subject.
this
is
the
theory
of
the
cosserat
surface
(
named
after
the
early
twentieth
century
french
elasticians
eugene
and
francois
cosserat
)
.
basically
,
the
cosserat
surface
is
a
mathematical
model
that
idealizes
a
shell-like
structure
as
a
curved
surface
upon
which
additional
independent
vector
fields
are
defined.
naghdi
was
able
to
show
that
inertia
,
momentum
,
and
angular
momentum
could
be
ascribed
to
the
additional
fields
in
such
a
way
that
a
set
of
general
dynamical
equations
for
the
deformations
of
shells
could
be
obtained.
he
was
invited
to
write
the
article
on
shells
and
plates
in
the
handbuch
der
physik.
this
appeared
in
<year>
(
in
vol.
via/<integer>
of
the
handbuch
)
and
is
universally
recognized
as
the
definitive
treatment
of
the
subject.
the
cosserat
surface
is
not
limited
to
modeling
only
solid
bodies.
as
naghdi
came
to
realize
in
the
late
<year>s
,
sheets
of
water
admit
the
same
kinematical
treatment
as
solid
shells
,
but
differ
in
respect
to
constitutive
properties.
naghdi
and
his
co-authors
developed
an
elegant
theory
of
fluid
surfaces
and
applied
it
successfully
to
a
wide
variety
of
problems
,
including
waves
on
a
stream
of
variable
depth
,
flow
past
obstacles
and
boats
in
lakes.
in
<year>
,
r.
cengiz
ertekin
,
a
phd
student
of
john
v.
wehausen
and
paul
naghdi
,
named
these
equations
the
green-naghdi
equations.
the
second
major
focal
area
that
attracted
naghdi
from
the
beginning
of
his
career
until
the
end
is
the
behavior
of
elastic-plastic
materials.
by
the
mid-<year>s
,
a
reasonably
satisfactory
theory
of
plasticity
had
been
developed
for
materials
undergoing
small
deformations.
naghdi
and
his
co-workers
performed
a
number
of
experimental
studies
and
also
contributed
several
analytical
papers
on
infinitesimal
plasticity.
naghdi
's
review
paper
of
<year>
set
forth
a
comprehensive
treatment
of
the
theory
of
infinitesimal
plasticity
and
is
still
widely
cited.
in
the
early
<year>s
,
naghdi
set
himself
the
task
of
extending
plasticity
theory
to
encompass
elastic-plastic
materials
at
finite
deformations.
this
was
a
formidable
challenge
,
since
almost
every
aspect
of
the
infinitesimal
theory
had
to
be
changed
in
order
to
accommodate
large
deformations.
his
<year>
plasticity
paper
with
his
friend
and
long-term
collaborator
a.e.
green
is
the
first
systematic
treatment
of
elastic-plastic
materials
undergoing
large
deformations.
over
the
next
two
decades
,
naghdi
continued
to
work
on
important
aspects
of
plasticity
,
and
in
<year>
,
thirty
years
after
the
publication
of
his
review
article
on
infinitesimal
plasticity
,
he
offered
an
even
finer
critical
account
of
the
modern
theory.
==
death
==
after
his
long
career
for
over
three
decades
as
a
professor
in
the
department
of
mechanical
engineering
,
he
succumbed
to
lung
cancer
at
his
home
in
berkeley
,
california.
he
died
on
july
<integer>

<year>.
==

==
in
recognition
of
his
achievements
,
naghdi
received
many
prestigious
awards.

knorozov
(
alternatively
knorosov
;

;
<day>

)
was
a
soviet
linguist
,
epigrapher
and
ethnographer
,
who
is
particularly
renowned
for
the
pivotal
role
his
research
played
in
the
decipherment
of
the
maya
script
,
the
writing
system
used
by
the
pre-columbian
maya
civilization
of
mesoamerica.
==
early
life
==
knorozov
was
born
in
the
village
of
pivdenne
near
kharkiv
,
at
that
time
the
capital
of
the
newly
formed
ukrainian
socialist
soviet
republic.
his
parents
were
russian
intellectuals
,
and
his
paternal
grandmother
maria
sakhavyan
had
been
a
stage
actress
of
national
repute
in
armenia.at
school
,
the
young
yuri
was
a
difficult
and
somewhat
eccentric
student
,
who
made
indifferent
progress
in
a
number
of
subjects
and
was
almost
expelled
for
poor
and
willful
behaviour.
however
,
it
became
clear
that
he
was
academically
bright
with
an
inquisitive
temperament
;
he
was
an
accomplished
violinist
,
wrote
romantic
poetry
and
could
draw
with
accuracy
and
attention
to
detail.in
<year>
at
the
age
of
<integer>
,
knorozov
left
kharkiv
for
moscow
where
he
commenced
undergraduate
studies
in
the
newly
created
department
of
ethnology
at
moscow
state
university
's
department
of
history.
he
initially
specialised
in
egyptology.
==
military
service

the

''
==
knorozov
's
study
plans
were
soon
interrupted
by
the
outbreak
of
world
war
ii
hostilities
along
the
eastern
front
in
mid-<year>.
from
<year>
to
<year>
knorozov
served
his
term
in
the
second
world
war
in
the
red
army
as
an
artillery
spotter.at
the
closing
stages
of
the
war
in
may
<year>
,
knorozov
and
his
unit
supported
the
push
of
the
red
army
vanguard
into
berlin.
it
was
here
,
sometime
in
the
aftermath
of
the
battle
of
berlin
,
that
knorozov
is
supposed
to
have
by
chance
retrieved
a
book
which
would
spark
his
later
interest
in
and
association
with
deciphering
the
maya
script.
in
their
retelling
,
the
details
of
this
episode
have
acquired
a
somewhat
folkloric
quality
,
as
``
...
one
of
the
greatest
legends
of
the
history
of
maya
research
''
.
the
story
has
been
much
reproduced
,
particularly
following
the
<year>
publication
of
michael
d.
coe
's
breaking
the
maya
code.according
to
this
version
of
the
anecdote
,
when
stationed
in
berlin
,
knorozov
came
across
the
national
library
while
it
was
ablaze.
somehow
knorozov
managed
to
retrieve
from
the
burning
library
a
book
,
which
remarkably
enough
turned
out
to
be
a
rare
edition
containing
reproductions
of
the
three
maya
codices
which
were
then
known—the
dresden
,
madrid
and
paris
codices.
knorozov
is
said
to
have
taken
this
book
back
with
him
to
moscow
at
the
end
of
the
war
,
where
its
examination
would
form
the
basis
for
his
later
pioneering
research
into
the
maya
script.
however
,
in
an
interview
conducted
a
year
before
his
death
,
knorozov
provided
a
different
version
of
the
anecdote.
as
he
explained
to
his
interlocutor
,
the
mayanist
epigrapher
harri
kettunen
of
the
university
of
helsinki
:
``
unfortunately
it
was
a
misunderstanding
:
i
told
about
it
[
finding
the
books
in
the
library
in
berlin
]
to
my
colleague
michael
coe
,
but
he
did
n't
get
it
right.
there
simply
was
n't
any
fire
in
the
library.
and
the
books
that
were
in
the
library
,
were
in
boxes
to
be
sent
somewhere
else.
the
fascist
command
had
packed
them
,
and
since
they
did
n't
have
time
to
move
them
anywhere
,
they
were
simply
taken
to
moscow.
i
did
n't
see
any
fire
there.
''
the
``
national
library
''
mentioned
in
these
accounts
is
not
specifically
identified
by
name
,
but
at
the
time
the
library
then
known
as
the
preußische
staatsbibliothek
(
prussian
state
library
)
had
that
function.
situated
on
unter
den
linden
and
today
known
as
the
berlin
state
library
(
staatsbibliothek
zu
berlin
)
,
this
was
the
largest
scientific
library
of
germany.
during
the
war
,
most
of
its
collection
had
been
dispersed
over
some
<integer>
separate
storage
places
across
the
country
for
safe-keeping.
after
the
war
much
of
the
collection
was
returned
to
the
library.
however
,
a
substantial
number
of
volumes
which
had
been
sent
for
storage
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
country
were
never
recovered
,
with
upwards
of
<integer>
,
<integer>
volumes
destroyed
and
a
further
<integer>
,
<integer>
missing.
of
these
,
many
ended
up
in
soviet
and
polish
library
collections
,
and
in
particular
at
the
russian
state
library
in
moscow.according
to
documentary
sources
,
the
so-called
``
berlin
affair
''
is
just
one
of
many
legends
related
to
the
personality
of
knorozov.
his
student
ershova
exposed
it
as
merely
a
legend
and
also
reported
that
documents
belonging
to
knorozov
,
such
as
his
military
i.d.
card
,
could
prove
that
he
did
not
take
part
in
the
battle
of
berlin
and
was
in
a
different
place
at
the
time
,
finishing
his
service
in
a
military
unit
located
near
moscow.
==
resumption
of
studies
==
in
the
autumn
of
<year>
after
world
war
ii
,
knorozov
returned
to
moscow
state
university
to
complete
his
undergraduate
courses
at
the
department
of
ethnography.
he
resumed
his
research
into
egyptology
,
and
also
undertook
comparative
cultural
studies
in
other
fields
such
as
sinology.
he
displayed
a
particular
interest
and
aptitude
for
the
study
of
ancient
languages
and
writing
systems
,
especially
hieroglyphs
,
and
he
also
read
in
medieval
japanese
and
arabic
literature.while
still
an
undergraduate
at
msu
,
knorozov
found
work
at
the
n.n.
miklukho-maklai
institute
of
ethnology
and
anthropology
(
or
iea
)
,
part
of
the
prestigious
academy
of
sciences
of
the
ussr.
knorozov
's
later
research
findings
would
be
published
by
the
iea
under
its
imprint.
as
part
of
his
ethnographic
curriculum
knorozov
spent
several
months
as
a
member
of
a
field
expedition
to
the
central
asian
soviet
republics
of
the
uzbek
and
turkmen
ssrs
(
what
had
formerly
been
the
khorezm
psr
,
and
would
much
later
become
the
independent
nations
of
uzbekistan
and
turkmenistan
following
the
<year>
breakup
of
the
soviet
union
)
.
on
this
expedition
his
ostensible
focus
was
to
study
the
effects
of
russian
expansionary
activities
and
modern
developments
upon
nomadic
ethnic
groups
,
of
what
was
a
far-flung
frontier
world
of
the
soviet
state.at
this
point
the
focus
of
his
research
had
not
yet
been
drawn
on
the
maya
script.
this
would
change
in
<year>
,
when
at
the
instigation
of
his
professor
,
knorozov
wrote
his
dissertation
on
the
``
de
landa
alphabet
''
,
a
record
produced
by
the
<integer>th
century
spanish
bishop
diego
de
landa
in
which
he
claimed
to
have
transliterated
the
spanish
alphabet
into
corresponding
maya
hieroglyphs
,
based
on
input
from
maya
informants.
de
landa
,
who
during
his
posting
to
yucatán
had
overseen
the
destruction
of
all
the
codices
from
the
maya
civilization
he
could
find
,
reproduced
his
alphabet
in
a
work
(
relación
de
las
cosas
de
yucatán
)
intended
to
justify
his
actions
once
he
had
been
placed
on
trial
when
recalled
to
spain.
the
original
document
had
disappeared
,
and
this
work
was
unknown
until
<year>
when
an
abridged
copy
was
discovered
in
the
archives
of
the
spanish
royal
academy
by
the
french
scholar
,
charles
étienne
brasseur
de
bourbourg.since
de
landa
's
``
alphabet
''
seemed
to
be
contradictory
and
unclear
(
e.g.
,
multiple
variations
were
given
for
some
of
the
letters
,
and
some
of
the
symbols
were
not
known
in
the
surviving
inscriptions
)
,
previous
attempts
to
use
this
as
a
key
for
deciphering
the
maya
writing
system
had
not
been
successful.
==
key
research
==
in
<year>
,
the
then
<integer>-year-old
knorozov
published
a
paper
which
was
later
to
prove
to
be
a
seminal
work
in
the
field
(
drevnyaya
pis’mennost’
tsentral’noy
ameriki
,
or
``
ancient
writing
of
central
america
''
.
)
the
general
thesis
of
this
paper
put
forward
the
observation
that
early
scripts
such
as
ancient
egyptian
and
cuneiform
which
were
generally
or
formerly
thought
to
be
predominantly
logographic
or
even
purely
ideographic
in
nature
,
in
fact
contained
a
significant
phonetic
component.
that
is
to
say
,
rather
than
the
symbols
representing
only
or
mainly
whole
words
or
concepts
,
many
symbols
in
fact
represented
the
sound
elements
of
the
language
in
which
they
were
written
,
and
had
alphabetic
or
syllabic
elements
as
well
,
which
if
understood
could
further
their
decipherment.
by
this
time
,
this
was
largely
known
and
accepted
for
several
of
these
,
such
as
egyptian
hieroglyphs
(
the
decipherment
of
which
was
famously
commenced
by
jean-françois
champollion
in
<year>
using
the
tri-lingual
rosetta
stone
artefact
)
;
however
the
prevailing
view
was
that
mayan
did
not
have
such
features.
knorozov
's
studies
in
comparative
linguistics
drew
him
to
the
conclusion
that
the
mayan
script
should
be
no
different
from
the
others
,
and
that
purely
logographic
or
ideographic
scripts
did
not
exist.knorozov
's
key
insight
was
to
treat
the
maya
glyphs
represented
in
de
landa
's
alphabet
not
as
an
alphabet
,
but
rather
as
a
syllabary.
he
was
perhaps
not
the
first
to
propose
a
syllabic
basis
for
the
script
,
but
his
arguments
and
evidence
were
the
most
compelling
to
date.
he
maintained
that
when
de
landa
had
commanded
of
his
informant
to
write
the
equivalent
of
the
spanish
letter
``
b
''
(
for
example
)
,
the
maya
scribe
actually
produced
the
glyph
which
corresponded
to
the
syllable
,
/be/
,
as
spoken
by
de
landa.
knorozov
did
not
actually
put
forward
many
new
transcriptions
based
on
his
analysis
,
nevertheless
he
maintained
that
this
approach
was
the
key
to
understanding
the
script.
in
effect
,
the
de
landa
``
alphabet
''
was
to
become
almost
the
``
rosetta
stone
''
of
mayan
decipherment.a
further
critical
principle
put
forward
by
knorozov
was
that
of
synharmony.
according
to
this
,
mayan
words
or
syllables
which
had
the
form
consonant-vowel-consonant
(
cvc
)
were
often
to
be
represented
by
two
glyphs
,
each
representing
a
cv-syllable
(
i.e.
,
cv-cv
)
.
in
the
reading
,
the
vowel
of
the
second
was
meant
to
be
ignored
,
leaving
the
reading
(
cvc
)
as
intended.
the
principle
also
stated
that
when
choosing
the
second
cv
glyph
,
it
would
be
one
with
an
echo
vowel
that
matched
the
vowel
of
the
first
glyph
syllable.
later
analysis
has
proved
this
to
be
largely
correct.
==
critical
reactions
to
his
work
==
upon
the
publication
of
this
work
from
a
then
hardly
known
scholar
,
knorozov
and
his
thesis
came
under
some
severe
and
at
times
dismissive
criticism.
j.
eric
s.
thompson
,
the
noted
british
scholar
regarded
by
most
as
the
leading
mayanist
of
his
day
,
led
the
attack.
thompson
's
views
at
that
time
were
solidly
anti-phonetic
,
and
his
own
large
body
of
detailed
research
had
already
fleshed-out
a
view
that
the
maya
inscriptions
did
not
record
their
actual
history
,
and
that
the
glyphs
were
founded
on
ideographic
principles.
his
view
was
the
prevailing
one
in
the
field
,
and
many
other
scholars
followed
suit.according
to
michael
coe
,
“during
thompson’s
lifetime
,
it
was
a
rare
maya
scholar
who
dared
to
contradict”
him
on
the
value
of
knorozov’s
contributions
or
on
most
other
questions.
as
a
result
,
decipherment
of
maya
scripts
took
much
longer
than
their
egyptian
or
hittite
counterparts
and
could
only
take
off
after
thompson’s
demise
in
<year>.the
situation
was
further
complicated
by
knorozov
's
paper
appearing
during
the
height
of
the
cold
war
,
and
many
were
able
to
dismiss
his
paper
as
being
founded
on
misguided
marxist-leninist
ideology
and
polemic.
indeed
,
in
keeping
with
the
mandatory
practices
of
the
time
,
knorozov
's
paper
was
prefaced
by
a
foreword
written
by
the
journal
's
editor
which
contained
digressions
and
propagandist
comments
extolling
the
state-sponsored
approach
by
which
knorozov
had
succeeded
where
western
scholarship
had
failed.
however
,
despite
claims
to
the
contrary
by
several
of
knorozov
's
detractors
,
knorozov
himself
never
did
include
such
polemic
in
his
writings.knorozov
persisted
with
his
publications
in
spite
of
the
criticism
and
rejection
of
many
mayanists
of
the
time.
he
was
perhaps
shielded
to
some
extent
from
the
ramifications
of
peer
disputation
,
since
his
position
and
standing
at
the
institute
was
not
adversely
influenced
by
criticism
from
western
academics.
==
progress
of
decipherment
==
knorozov
further
improved
his
decipherment
technique
in
his
<year>
monograph
``
the
writing
of
the
maya
indians
''
and
published
translations
of
mayan
manuscripts
in
his
<year>
work
``
maya
hieroglyphic
manuscripts
''
.during
the
<year>s
,
other
mayanists
and
researchers
began
to
expand
upon
knorozov
's
ideas.
their
further
field-work
and
examination
of
the
extant
inscriptions
began
to
indicate
that
actual
maya
history
was
recorded
in
the
stelae
inscriptions
,
and
not
just
calendric
and
astronomical
information.
the
russian-born
but
american-resident
scholar
tatiana
proskouriakoff
was
foremost
in
this
work
,
eventually
convincing
thompson
and
other
doubters
that
historical
events
were
recorded
in
the
script.other
early
supporters
of
the
phonetic
approach
championed
by
knorozov
included
michael
d.
coe
and
david
kelley
,
and
whilst
initially
they
were
in
a
clear
minority
,
more
and
more
supporters
came
to
this
view
as
further
evidence
and
research
progressed.through
the
rest
of
the
decade
and
into
the
next
,
proskouriakoff
and
others
continued
to
develop
the
theme
,
and
using
knorozov
's
results
and
other
approaches
began
to
piece
together
some
decipherments
of
the
script.
a
major
breakthrough
came
during
the
first
round
table
or
mesa
redonda
conference
at
the
maya
site
of
palenque
in
<year>
,
when
using
the
syllabic
approach
those
present
(
mostly
)
deciphered
what
turned
out
to
be
a
list
of
former
rulers
of
that
particular
maya
city-state.subsequent
decades
saw
many
further
such
advances
,
to
the
point
now
where
quite
a
significant
portion
of
the
surviving
inscriptions
can
be
read.
most
mayanists
and
accounts
of
the
decipherment
history
apportion
much
of
the
credit
to
the
impetus
and
insight
provided
by
knorozov
's
contributions
,
to
a
man
who
had
been
able
to
make
important
contributions
to
the
understanding
of
this
distant
,
ancient
civilisation.in
retrospect
,
prof.
coe
writes
that
``
yuri
knorozov
,
a
man
who
was
far
removed
from
the
western
scientific
establishment
and
who
,
prior
to
the
late
<year>s
,
never
saw
a
mayan
ruin
nor
touch
a
real
mayan
inscription
,
had
nevertheless
,
against
all
odds
,
“made
possible
the
modern
decipherment
of
maya
hieroglyphic
writing.”
==
later
life
==
knorozov
had
presented
his
work
in
<year>
at
the
international
congress
of
americanists
in
copenhagen
,
but
in
the
ensuing
years
he
was
not
able
to
travel
abroad
at
all.
after
diplomatic
relations
between
guatemala
and
the
soviet
union
were
restored
in
<year>
,
knorozov
was
invited
by
president
vinicio
cerezo
to
visit
guatemala.
president
cerezo
awarded
knorozov
the
order
of
the
quetzal
and
knorozov
visited
several
of
the
major
mayan
archaeological
sites
,
including
tikal.
the
government
of
mexico
awarded
knorozov
the
order
of
the
aztec
eagle
,
the
highest
decoration
awarded
by
the
mexican
state
to
non-citizens
,
in
a
ceremony
at
the
mexican
embassy
in
moscow
on
november
<integer>
,
<year>.knorozov
had
broad
interests
in
,
and
contributed
to
,
other
investigative
fields
such
as
archaeology
,
semiotics
,
human
migration
to
the
americas
,
and
the
evolution
of
the
mind.
however
,
it
is
his
contributions
to
the
field
of
maya
studies
for
which
he
is
best
remembered.in
his
very
last
years
,
knorozov
is
also
known
to
have
pointed
to
a
place
in
the
united
states
as
the
likely
location
of
chicomoztoc
,
the
ancestral
land
from
which—according
to
ancient
documents
and
accounts
considered
mythical
by
a
sizable
number
of
scholars—indigenous
peoples
now
living
in
mexico
are
said
to
have
come.knorozov
died
in
saint
petersburg
on
march
<integer>
,
<year>
,
of
pneumonia
in
the
corridors
of
a
city
hospital
(
his
daughter
ekaterina

that
he
died
in
a

at

surrounded
by
the

goldman-rakic
was
the
first
to
discover
and
describe
the
circuitry
of
the
prefrontal
cortex
and
its
relationship
to
working
memory.
previously
,
scientists
thought
that
the
higher
cognitive
functions
of
the
prefrontal
cortex
were
beyond
the
scope
of
scientific
study.
goldman-rakic
's
research
showed
that
methods
employed
to
study
the
sensory
cortices
could
be
adapted
to
the
highest
order
prefrontal
cortical
areas
,
revealing
the
circuit
basis
for
higher
cognitive
function.
because
of
goldman-rakic
,
scientists
began
to
better
understand
the
neurobiological
basis
of
higher
cognitive
function
,
and
of
such
disorders
as
schizophrenia
,
alzheimer
's
,
attention
deficit
hyperactivity
disorder
(
adhd
)
,
cerebral
palsy
,
parkinson
's
disease
,
and
dementia.
she
used
a
multidisciplinary
approach
,
applying
biochemical
,
electrophysiological
,
pharmacological
,
anatomical
and
behavioral
techniques
to
study
working
memory.
she
pioneered
the
first
studies
of
dopamine
influences
on
prefrontal
cortical
function
,
research
that
is
critical
to
our
understanding
of
schizophrenia
,

and

of
the
robin
and
swifts
in

he
developed
what
is
now
known
as
lack

principle
which
explained
the
evolution
of
avian
clutch

in
terms
of
individual
selection
as
opposed
to
the
competing
contemporary
idea
that
they
had
evolved
for
the
benefit
of
species
(
also
known
as
group

)
.
his
pioneering
life-history
studies
of
the
living

helped
in
changing
the
nature
of
ornithology
from
what
was

although
his

had
some
interest
in
birds
as
a

it
does
not
appear
that
he
influenced
david

his
mother
kathleen
was
the

david
did
not
wish
to
follow
his

and
took
an
interest
in

his

then
considered

and
found

<year>
when
he
took

he
made
his
first
trip
to
the

as
a
chaperone
for
a

returning

he
went
to

august
<year>
was
spent
at
the

which
held
a
large
collection
of

of

that
had
been
studied
earlier
by
harry
swarth
and
at
ernst
mayr
's
home
in

while
in

he
made
a

with
john
t.

he
returned
home
in
september

,
after
the
outbreak

lack
published
the
galapagos
finches
(
geospizinae
)
,
a
study
in
variation
in
which
he
examined
variations
within
species
across
islands
and
considered
that
many
of
them
were
non-adaptive
and
due
to
founder
effect
and
genetic
drift.
lack
's
first
major
work
was
the
life
of
the
robin
,
which
was
based
on
four
years
of
field
work
that
he
conducted
while
teaching
at
dartington
hall
school.
he
examined
robin
behaviour
,
song
,
territory
,
pairing
and
breeding
using
ringing
to
mark
and
track
individual
birds.
the
manuscript
was
completed
in
<year>
and
it
went
through
five
editions
from
<year>
to
<year>.
one
of
lack
's
students
at
dartington
hall
was
eva
ibbotson.
a
colleague
who
helped
in
filming
some
of
the
robins
for
lack
was
the
geography
teacher
bill
hunter.
in
<year>
lack
went
to
tanganyika
on
an
invitation
from
r.e.
moreau.
lack
was
committed
to
pacificism
and
debated
the
philosophy
even
during
his
dartington
days
with
the
founder
of
the
college
,
leonard
knight
elmhirst.
during
world
war

lack
however
served
with
a
british
army
unit
called
the
army
operational
research
group
on
the
orkney
islands
working
on
radar
use.
during
this
work
he
met
other
biologists
who
had
been
inducted
into
the
war
including
george
varley
,
an
entomologist
who
introduced
him
to
the
idea
of
density-dependent
regulation
of
animal
populations.
lack
's
observations
on
spurious
echoes
produced
by
birds
would
later
allow
him
to
establish
the
field
of
radar
ornithology
to
study
bird
migration.
lack
was
released
from
wartime
duty
in
august
<year>
so
as
to
take
a
position
to
as
director
(
succeeding
w.b.
alexander
)
of
the
edward
grey
institute
of
field
ornithology
at
oxford
university
,
a
position
that
he
held
until
his
death
in
<year>.
lack
's
work
in
ornithology
was
almost
entirely
based
on
studies
of
the
living
bird.
he
was
one
of
the
pioneers
of
life-history
studies
in
britain
,
especially
those
based
on
quantitative
approaches
,
when
some
traditional
ornithologists
of
the
time
were
focussing
their
studies
on
morphology
and
geographic
distribution.
lack
's
major
scientific
research
included
work
on
population
biology
and
density
dependent
regulation.
his
work
suggested
that
natural
selection
favoured
clutch
sizes
that
ensured
the
greatest
number
of
surviving
young.
this
interpretation
was
however
debated
by
v.c.
wynne-edwards
who
suggested
that
clutch
size
was
density-independent.
this
was
one
of
the
earliest
debates
on
group
selection.
lack
's
studies
were
based
on
nidicolous
birds
and
some
recent
studies
have
suggested
that
his
findings
may
not
hold
for
other
groups
such
as
seabirds.as
a
mentor
for
numerous
doctoral
students
,
lack
followed
a
hands-off
method
,
letting
students
decide
their
own
research
topics.
he
encouraged
students
to
sort
out
their
ideas
and
find
the
``
simplest
explanation
,
which
was
probably
best.
''
he
would
make
students
work
on
their
papers
and
give
only
one
reading
to
their
thesis
asking
them
to
choose
either
a
draft
or
a
final
version
to
submit.he
wrote
numerous
papers
in
ornithological
journals
,
and
had
a
knack
of
choosing
memorable
titles
:
he
once
claimed
to
have
single-handedly
caused
the
renaming
of
a
group
of
birds
through
the
submission
of
a
scientific
paper
with
the
title
``
territory
and
polygamy
in
a
bishop
''
.
this
<year>
publication
was
subsequently
titled
``
territory
and
polygamy
in
a
bishop
bird
,
euplectes
hordeacea
hordeacea
(
linn.
)
''
in
the
journal
ibis
as
the
journal
editor
felt
that
the
title
might
cause
misunderstanding.
===
darwin
's
finches
===
lack
's
most
famous
work
is
darwin
's
finches
,
a
landmark
study
whose
title
linked
darwin
's
name
with
the
galapagos
group
of
species
and
popularised
the
term
``
darwin
's
finches
''
in
<year>
,
though
the
term
had
been
introduced
by
percy
lowe
in
<year>.
there
are
two
versions
of
this
work
,
differing
significantly
in
their
conclusions.
the
first
is
a
book-length
monograph
,
written
after
his
visit
to
the
galapagos
,
but
not
published
until
<year>.
in
it
lack
interprets
the
differences
in
bill
size
as
species
recognition
signals
,
that
is
,
as
isolating
mechanisms.
the
second
is
the
later
book
in
which
the
differences
in
bill
size
are
interpreted
as
adaptations
to
specific
food
niches
,
an
interpretation
that
has
since
been
abundantly
confirmed.
this
change
of
mind
,
according
to
lack
's
preface
,
came
about
as
a
result
of
his
reflections
on
his
own
data
whilst
he
was
doing
war
work.
the
effect
of
this
change
in
interpretation
is
to
put
the
emphasis
for
speciation
onto
natural
selection
for
appropriate
food
handling
instead
of
seeing
it
primarily
as
a
by-product
of
an
isolating
mechanism.
in
this
way
his
work
contributed
to
the
modern
evolutionary
synthesis
,
in
which
natural
selection
came
to
be
seen
as
the
prime
mover
in
evolution
,
and
not
random
or
mutational
events.
lack
's
work
laid
the
foundations
for
the
much
more
extensive
work
of
peter
and
rosemary
grant
and
their
colleagues.
lack
's
work
feeds
into
studies
of
island
biogeography
which
continue
the
same
range
of
issues
presented
by
the
galapagos
fauna
on
a
more
varied
canvas.
according
to
ernst
mayr
,
``
the
person
who
more
than
anyone
else
deserves
credit
for
reviving
an
interest
in
the
ecological
significance
of
species
was
david
lack
...
it
is
now
quite
clear
that
the
process
of
speciation
is
not
completed
by
the
acquisition
of
isolating
mechanisms
but
requires
also
the
acquisition
of
adaptations
that
permit
co-existence
with
potential
competitors.
''
===
lack
's
principle
===
in
<year>
lack
took
an
interest
in
clutch
size
after
reading
moreau
's
manuscript
sent
to
the
ibis.
lack
was
then
an
assistant
to
the
editor
of
the
ibis.
lack
postulated
what
is
now
known
as
lack
's
principle
,
which
states
that
``
the
clutch
size
of
each
species
of
bird
has
been
adapted
by
natural
selection
to
correspond
with
the
largest
number
of
young
for
which
the
parents
can
,
on
average
,
provide
enough
food
''
.
===
population
regulation
===
lack
took
a
keen
interest
in
the
mechanisms
involved
in
regulating
populations
in
nature.
the
natural
regulation
of
animal
numbers
is
one
of
lack
's
most
frequently
cited
works.
here
he
gave
primacy
to
natural
selection
in
determining
the
rate
of
reproduction
and
he
especially
countered
the
idea
that
it
was
adjusted
with
mortality
rates
so
that
constant
populations
are
maintained.
it
was
critiqued
by
j.b.s.
haldane
who
found
it
lacking
mathematical
precision
and
biased
to
bird
studies.
the
other
major
critic
was
v.c.
wynne-edwards
with
whom
he
clashed
for
nearly
a
decade.
lack
followed
up
on
the
criticisms
in
his
later
books
including
population
studies
of
birds

david

married
elizabeth
lack
(
née
silva
)
who
was
also
an
ornithologist.
elizabeth
silva
was
born
in
hertfordshire
in
<year>
and
took
an
early
interest
in
music.
she
wished
to
joined
the
royal
academy
of
music
in
london
but
the
war
led
to
her
serving
in
the
auxiliary
territorial
service
as
an
ambulance
driver
in
europe.
after
the
war
she
applied
for
work
and
due
to
her
interest
in
birds
she
sent
her
resume
to
richard
fitter
who
passed
it
on
to
david
lack
with
a
note
``
here

''
lack
however
interviewed
her
and
appointed
her
as
a
secretary.
noting
her
interest
in
birds
,
he
also
invited
her
to
serve
as
a
field
assistant
for
studies
in
the
wytham
woods.
she
also
helped
in
the
study
of
swifts.
one

elizabeth
did
not
return
to

after
her
observations
of

zoo
keeper
at
john
aspinall
's
zoo
at
howletts
,
where
he
perfected
his
skills
of
primate
rehabilitation
and
care.
john
aspinall
had
set
up
a
breeding
programme
for
gorillas
which
were
an
endangered
species.
cronin
's
passion
for
working
with
primates
made
him
quite
successful
in
his
career
and
encouraged
him
to
have
an
ambition
of
one
day
building
a
safe
haven
for
mistreated
primates.
during
his
years
working
at
john
aspinall
's
zoo
,
he
gave
himself
the
necessary
experience
of
dealing
with
apes
on
a
daily
basis
in
his
career
path
of
working
with
them
as
well
as
small
monkeys
and
their
complex
life
necessities.
==
monkey
world
==
it
was
during
cronin
's
years
working
as
a
zoo
keeper
at
the
howletts
zoo
that
he
was
notified
about
the
plight
of
chimps
being
abused.
these
african
great
apes
were
being
smuggled
from
the
wild
by
illegal
poachers
and
being
transported
abroad
to
europe
,
where
the
young
chimpanzees
were
being
purchased
then
used
as
photographic
props
by
photographers
on
beach
resorts
in
spain.
these
chimps
would
suffer
horrible
abuse
–
having
their
teeth
knocked
out
to
prevent
them
biting
tourists
,
drugged
to
remain
sedate
,
and
physically
beaten
to
remain
submissive
and
easy
to
handle
before
growing
too
big
and
being
killed
to
be
simply
replaced
by
another.
cronin
was
infuriated
by
the
fate
that
these
magnificent
apes
encountered
and
decided
to
dedicate
his
life
in
trying
to
solve
the
problem.
in
the
middle
<year>s
spain
had
released
legislation
that
forbade
the
use
of
chimpanzees
as
photographer
's
props
,
and
this
turn
of
action
gave
cronin
some
optimism
on
how
he
would
reach
his
goal
of
helping
the
chimps.
in
<year>
cronin
approached
a
british
couple
called
simon
and
peggy
templer
who
had
started
rescuing
the
beach
chimps
in
<year>.
cronin
worked
together
with
the
templers
who
had
set
up
a
half-way
house
where
the
confiscated
chimps
were
being
housed.
the
chimps
would
not
be
able
to
stay
there
for
long
,
and
it
was
cronin
's
idea
that
shed
light.
cronin
requested
discussions
on
how
he
could
possibly
help
and
with
the
assistance
of
the
spanish
authorities
(
the
guardia
civil
)
confiscating
the
chimps
,
there
would
certainly
be
more
individuals
arriving
at
the
small
half-way
house.
during
<year>
cronin
returned
to
england
and
focused
on
how
he
could
possibly
build
a
sanctuary
for
the
chimps.
the
templers
agreed
to
re-home
the
chimps
at
the
sanctuary
which
cronin
promised
to
be
able
to
build.
cronin
recruited
help
from
his
best
friend
jeremy
keeling
,
who
was
a
fellow
zoo
keeper
,
and
the
pair
set
out
to
achieve
their
ambition
of
a
primate
sanctuary.
cronin
was
notified
about
an
abandoned
pig
farm
located
near
wool
,
dorset.
the
old
land
covered
<integer>
acres
and
would
be
perfect
for
what
would
become
a
primate
rescue
centre.
after
securing
a
small
business
loan
,
cronin
acquired
permission
to
build
the
first
enclosure
which
would
be
for
the
chimps.
he
knew
that
the
animals
needed
to
know
how
to
live
a
natural
way
of
life
again
,
therefore
cronin
set
up
a
map
of
the
enclosure
which
would
cover
two
acres
,
filled
with
grass
,
shrubs
and
custom-built
climbing
structures
made
from
telephone
poles.
the
whole
two
acres
would
be
surrounded
by
an
electric
fence.
after
some
finishing
touches
,
such
as
human
resources
like
a
café
and
a
children
's
playground
,
the
sanctuary
was
finally
complete
and
was
named
monkey
world
ape
rescue
centre.
in
july
<year>
,
cronin
was
able
to
bring
the
first
group
of
nine
chimps
from
the
templers
'
half-way
house
to
monkey
world.
once
at
the
park
,
the
chimpanzees
were
rehabilitated
and
housed
in
their
new
accommodations.
also
within
the
park
was
one
hand-reared
female
bornean
orang-utan
named
amy
,
who
was
brought
by
jeremy
keeling
,
whose
job
it
was
to
look
after
the
animals
at
the
centre.
there
was
the
arrival
of
some
barbary
macaques
,
pig-tailed
macaques
and
some
ring-tailed
lemurs
,
which
made
up
the
rest
of
the
collection
of
primates
housed
in
cronin
's
rescue
centre.
more
chimpanzees
from
spain
arrived
at
the
park.
cronin
opened
monkey
world
on
<day>
,
providing
the
public
with
a
rare
opportunity
to
observe
exotic
primates.
he
made
the
sanctuary
a
rescue
centre
and
not
a
zoo.
the
female
chimpanzees
were
put
on
birth
control
to
save
space
for
more
individuals
needing
rescuing.
monkey
world
did
not
only
rescue
spanish
beach
chimps
,
but
chimps
from
a
variety
of
circumstances
such
as
exotic
pets
,
circus
entertainers
and
medical
research
laboratory
subjects.
in
<year>
,
cronin
met
alison
ames
,
an
authority
on
animal
behaviour
and
cambridge
graduate
in
biological
anthropology.
she
and
cronin
were
married
in
<year>
,
from
then
on
running
monkey
world
as
a
combined
venture.
cronin
could
hardly
believe
that
his
small
refuge
centre
had
grown
into
a
thriving
rescue
centre
for
primates
from
around
the
world.
monkey
world
worked
with
the
ping
tung
rescue
centre
in
taiwan
in
stopping
the
illegal
smuggling
of
apes
from
the
wild
,
and
monkey
world
was
able
to
re-home
some
of
the
primates
from
the
ping
tung
rescue
centre
,
including
bornean
orang-utans
and
different
species
of
gibbon.
monkey
world
started
working
with
foreign
governments
in
the
prevention
of
primate
smuggling
for
pet
trades
,
including
the
pet
trade
in
britain
which
allowed
citizens
to
keep
exotic
small
monkeys
without
being
able
to
care
for
them
properly
or
meet
their
substantial
needs.
cronin
and
alison
travelled
to
places
around
the
world
,
investigating
animal
trades
,
especially
the
trade
and
exploitation
of
primates.
cronin
's
sanctuary
had
successfully
recruited
a
number
of
primate
care
staff
who
see
that
the
day-to-day
requirements
of
the
primates
are
met.
veterinary
consultants
were
brought
in
to
help
treat
the
animals
and
adoption
schemes
were
set
up
to
allow
the
park
to
continue
its
rescue
and
rehabilitation
work.
the
biggest
rescue
the
centre
undertook
was
that
of
the
<integer>

macaques
from
a
medical
research
laboratory
in

the
rescue
mission

schenectady
,
oldendorf
completed
a
residency
in
psychiatry
through
the
new
york
state
department
of
mental
health
residency
training
program.
then
he
enlisted
for
active

states
navy
as
a
medical
officer
and
was
posted
at
the
u.s.
naval
hospital
in

,
rhode
island.
two
years
later
oldendorf
left
the
navy
to
complete
a
fellowship
in
neurology
at
the
university
of
minnesota
hospitals
in
minneapolis
,
minnesota
;
for
this
reason
,
he
was
subsequently
certified
by
the
american
board
of
psychiatry
and
neurology
as
a
diplomate
in
both
specialties.
==

in
<year>
,
oldendorf
joined
the
faculty
of
the
new
medical
school
at
the
university
of
california
,
los
angeles
and
the
staff
of
the
nearby
ucla-affiliated
west
los

veterans
administration
medical
center.
he
became
an
active
member
of
the
academic
community
,
where
his
scientific
,
clinical
,
and
teaching
abilities
were
admired
at
the
bedside
,
in
seminars
,
at
clinical
conferences
,
in
the
auditorium
,
and
in
his
laboratory.
he
engaged
students
and
colleagues
in
long
discussions
about
neurologic
theory
,
the
scientific
process
,
or
results
of
medical
research.
by
<year>
,
oldendorf
was
an
attending
neurologist
at
the
wadsworth
va-ucla
medical
center
where
his
ability
to
apply
techniques
from
one
field
to
another
did
not
go
unnoticed.
he
was
universally
characterized
as
``
likable
''
,
``
friendly
''
,
``
amusing
''
,
``
creative
''
,
``
intense
''
,
and
``
humble
''
.
oldendorf
's
interest
neuroimaging
was
precipitated
by
a
dislike
for
invasive
procedures
(
like
pneumoencephalography
and
direct
carotid
puncture
)
that
he
performed
as
a
clinical
neurologist.
oldendorf
found
that
these
traumatic
,
tedious
tests
provided
only
limited
and
indirect
information
about
the
brain.
at
ucla
,
he
started
his
seminal
investigations
into
the
two
major
lines
of
research
that
would
define
his
career
:
x-ray
shadow
radiography
and
cerebral
angiography.
the
first
line
was
influential
in
the
evolving
concept
of
neuroimaging
;
the
second
yielded
fundamental
knowledge
of
brain
metabolism
and
mechanisms
of
the
blood–brain
barrier.
==
contributions
to
medical
science
==
===
role
in
development
of
neuroimaging
===
in
<year>
,
oldendorf
conceived
an
idea
for
``
scanning
a
head
through
a
transmitted
beam
of
x-rays
,
and
being
able
to
reconstruct
the
radiodensity
patterns
of
a
plane
through
the
head
''
by
watching
an
engineer
who
was
working
on
an
automated
apparatus
to
reject
frostbitten
fruit
by
detecting
dehydrated
portions.
not
until
<year>
did
he
complete
a
working
prototype
of
his
idea
,
apply
(
for
$
<integer>
)
for
a
patent
on
his
idea
,
and
publish
an
article
detailing
the
work.
ingeniously
,
by
using
materials
found
in
his
home
(
such
as
his
son
's
toy
train
,
a
phonograph
turntable
,
and
an
alarm
clock
motor
)
,
oldendorf
demonstrated
a
method
of
producing
cross-sectional
images
of
soft
tissue
by
back-projection
and
reconstruction.
in
his
landmark
paper
,
also
published
in
<year>
,
he
described
the
basic
concept
later
used
by
allan
mcleod
cormack
to
develop
the
mathematics
behind
computerized
tomography
,
though
prof.
cormack
was
unaware
of
oldendorf
's
work.
in
october
,
<year>
oldendorf
finally
received
a
u.s.
patent
for
a
``
radiant
energy
apparatus
for
investigating
selected
areas
of
interior
objects
obscured
by
dense
material
,
''
.
this
work
was
recognized
by
godfrey
hounsfield
as
the
only
other
attempt
at
tomographic
reconstruction
,
and
,
indeed
,
formed
the
basis
of
much
of
his
nobel
prize-winning
work.
the
prototype
developed
by
dr.
oldendorf
,
however
,
did
not
lead
to
the
development
of
the
first
industrial
cat
scanning
device.
when
suggested
to
a
leading
x-ray
manufacturer
of
the
time
,
the
president
of
the
company
retorted
,
even
if
it
could
be
made
to
work
as
you
suggest
,
we
can
not
imagine
a
significant
market
for
such
an
expensive
apparatus
which
would
do
nothing
but
make
a
radiographic
cross-section
of
a
head.
faced
with
this
reaction
,
oldendorf
``
turned
his
attention
to
other
scientific
work
and
heard
nothing
further
about
the
idea
until
<year>.
''
however
,
his
idea
was
a
fundamental
discovery
which
also
led
to
mri
,
positron
emission
tomography
(
pet
)
,
single
photon
emission
computed
tomography
(
spect
)
,
and
other
imaging
techniques.
once
these
techniques
became
widely
accepted
,
dr.
oldendorf
,
along
with
william
markley
mckinney
,
md
(
<year>–<year>
)
were
instrumental
in
promoting
the
use
of
computed
tomography
among
neurologists
to
help
decrease
the
use
of
superfluous
and
invasive
tests.
===
blood–brain
barrier
===
oldendorf
made
many
other
discoveries
that
have
significantly
affected
neuroscience
and
the
practice
of
medicine.
he
developed
an
original
method
to
analyze
blood
flow
in
the
brain
and
the
kinetics
of
blood-brain
permeability.
the
idea
of
the
blood–brain
barrier
was
already
entrenched
in
medical
science
by
this
time
,
but
had
never
been
quantified.
oldendorf
's
work
in
measuring
blood
flow
with
radioactive
isotopes
was
fundamental
to
the
subsequent
development
of
techniques
now
used
in
many
nuclear
medicine
laboratories.
his
methods
of
assessing
blood–brain
barrier
permeability
increased
knowledge
of
the
mechanisms
whereby
drugs
and
metabolic
substrates
enter
into
the
brain.
especially
important
was
his
characterization
of
more
than
a
dozen
independent
carrier
systems
,
along
with
their
saturation
kinetics.
today
,
most
of
what
is
known
of
the
selective
permeability
of
the
blood–brain
barrier
was
either
established
by
oldendorf
in
his
laboratory
,
or
by
others
using
his
ingenious
techniques.
these
results
have
been
essential
in
developing
pet
and
spect
imaging
;
in
studying
glucose
transport
and
brain
metabolism
;
and
in
characterizing
clinically
important
diseases
such
as
cerebral
ischemia
,
starvation
,
and
epilepsy.
oldendorf
's
experiments
were
also
was
the
first
to
prove
that
cerebrospinal
fluid
functions
as
a
``
sink
''
in
relationship
to
brain
metabolism
,
a
concept
that
is
being
investigated
in
relation
to
the
pathophysiology
of
presenile
dementias
such
as
alzheimer
's
disease.
===

told
of
horrific
abuses

out

leaving

give
testimony

lantos
replied
,
``
the
notion
that
any

have
no

the

if

that
in
no

diminishes
the

the

sent

distanced

it
any

this
is
not

knock
on
you

on
you

the
fact
remains

i
do

comparisons

of

current
u.s.
activities

two

he
laid
the
foundations
of
the
orangi
pilot
project
for
the
largest
squatter
community
of
orangi
in
the
city.
he
remained
associated
with
this
project
until
his
death
in
<year>.
meanwhile
,
he
maintained
his
support
for
rural
communities
around
karachi
,
and
also
helped
to
develop
the
aga
khan
rural
support
programme.
opp
became
a
model
for
participatory
bottom-up
development
initiatives.

comilla
cooperative
pilot
project
===
the
comilla
model
(
<year>
)
was
khan
's
initiative
in
response
to
the
failure
of
a
village
agricultural
and
industrial
development
(
v-aid
)
programme
that
was
launched
in
<year>
in
east
and
west
pakistan
with
technical
assistance
from
the
us
government.
v-aid
remained
a
government-level
attempt
to
promote
citizen
participation
in
the
sphere
of
rural
development.
khan
launched
the
project
in
<year>
on
his
return
from
michigan
,
and
developed
a
methodology
of
implementation
in
the
areas
of
agricultural
and
rural
development
on
the
principle
of
grassroots-level
participation.
initially
,
the
aim
was
to
provide
a
development
model
of
programmes
and
institutions
that
could
be
replicated
across
the
country.
advisory
support
in
this
respect
was
provided
by
experts
from
harvard
and
michigan
state
universities
,
the
ford
foundation
,
and
usaid.comilla
model
simultaneously
addressed
the
problems
that
were
caused
by
the
inadequacy
of
both
local
infrastructure
and
institutions
through
a
range
of
integrated
programmes.
the
initiatives
included
the
establishment
of
:
a
training
and
development
centre
;
a
road-drainage
embankment
works
programme
;
a
decentralized
,
small
scale
irrigation
programme
;
and
,
a
two-tiered
cooperative
system
with
primary
cooperatives
operating
in
the
villages
,
and
federations
operating
at
sub-district
level.after
khan
's
departure
from
comilla
,
the
cooperative
's
model
failed
in
independent
bangladesh
because
only
a
few
occupational
groups
managed
to
achieve
the
desired
success.
by
<year>
,
only
<integer>
of
the
<integer>
cooperatives
were
functioning.
the
model
actually
fell
prey
to
the
ineffective
internal
and
external
controls
,
stagnation
,
and
diversion
of
funds.
this
prompted
the
subsequent
scholars
and
practitioners
in
microfinance
,
such
as
muhammad
yunus
of
grameen
bank
and
fazle
hasan
abed
of
brac
,
to
abandon
the
cooperative
approach
in
favour
of
more
centralised
control
and
service
delivery
structures.
the
new
strategy
targeted
the
poorest
villagers
,
while
excluding
the
'less
poor'.
however
,
khan
's
leadership
skills
during
the
course
of
his
association
with
the
project
remained
a
source
of
inspiration
for
these
leaders
,
as
well
as
other
participatory
development
initiatives
in
the
country.
===
orangi
pilot
project
===
the
orangi
poverty
alleviation
project
(
known
as
the
orangi
pilot
project
,
or
opp
)
was
initiated
by
khan
as
an
ngo
in
<year>.
orangi
is
located
on
the
northwest
periphery
of
karachi.
at
that
time
,
it
was
the
largest
of
the
city
's
approximately
<integer>
low-income
squatter
settlements
(
known
as
katchi
abadi
)
.
the
locality
was
first
developed
in
<year>
as
a
government
township
of
<integer>
square
kilometres
(
<integer>
,
<integer>
acres
)
.
the
influx
of
migrants
after
the
creation
of
bangladesh
swelled
the
settlement
to
about
one
million
people
crowded
over
an
area
of
more
than
<integer>
square
kilometres
(
<integer>
,
<integer>
acres
)
.
the
working
class
multi-ethnic
population
was
predominantly
composed
of
day
labourers
,
skilled
workers
,
artisans
,
small
shopkeepers
,
peddlers
and
low-income
white
collar
workers.
the
project
proved
an
impetus
to
the
socio-economic
development
of
the
population
of
the
area.
as
the
project
director
,
khan
proved
to
be
a
dynamic
and
innovative
leader.
the
project
initially
focused
on
creating
a
system
of
underground
sewers
,
using
local
materials
and
labour
,
and
succeeded
in
laying
hundreds
of
kilometres
of
drainage
pipes
along
with
auxiliary
facilities.
within
a
decade
of
the
initiative
,
local
residents
had
established
schools
,
health
clinics
,
women
's
work
centres
,
cooperative
stores
and
a
credit
organisation
to
finance
enterprise
projects.
by
<year>
,
opp
had
managed
to
provide
low-cost
sewers
to
more
than
<integer>
,
<integer>
houses.
the
project
subsequently
diversified
into
a
number
of
programmes
,
including
a
people
's
financed
and
managed
low-cost
sanitation
programme
;
a
housing
programme
;
a
basic
health
and
family
planning
programme
;
a
programme
of
supervised
credit
for
small
family
enterprise
units
;
an
education
programme
;
and
a
rural
development
programme
in
the
nearby
villages.comparing
the
opp
with
comilla
project
,
akhter
hameed
khan
once
commented
:
the
orangi
pilot
project
was
very
different
from
the
comilla
academy.
opp
was
a
private
body
,
dependent
for
its
small
fixed
budget
on
another
ngo.
the
vast
resources
and
support
of
the
government
,
harvard
advisors
,
msu
,
and
ford
foundation
was
missing.
opp
possessed
no
authority
,
no
sanctions.
it
may
observe
and
investigate
but
it
could
only
advise
,
not
enforce.
the
successful
opp
model
became
an
inspiration
for
other
municipalities
around
the
country.
in
<year>
,
khan
helped
to
create
lodhran
pilot
project
(
lpp
)
to
collaborate
with
lodhran
municipal
committee.
learning
from
past
experiences
,
the
project
extended
its
scope
to
the
whole
town
instead
of
concentrating
on
low-income
settlements
only.
the
municipal
partnership
was
itself
a
new
initiative
that
ensured
wider
civic
co-operation.the
success
of
opp
did
come
at
a
cost
for
dr
khan
as
his
liberal
views
and
self-help
initiatives
were
questioned
and
criticised
by
certain
interest
groups.
at
two
occasions
,
he
was
accused
of
blasphemy.
however
,
all
allegations
against
him
were
acquitted
by
the
courts
of
law
and
cleared
by
independent
religious
scholars.
==
death
==
in
<year>
,
khan
was
visiting
his
family
in

when
he
suffered

kidney
failure.
he

of
myocardial
infarction
on

he
was
buried
on
the
grounds
of
the

a

,
on

bronze
coins.
over
the
next
decade
he
wrote
four
books
on

his
view
was
that
the
tension
between
the
eccentricity
of

roman
emperors
and
the
traditionalism
of
the
roman
mint
made
coins
(
used
as
both
propaganda

in
london
after

he
was
assigned
(
<year>

as
the
uk

according
to
his

he
was

early

according
to
the
times
:
grant
's
approach
to
classical
history
was
beginning
to
divide
critics.
numismatists
felt
that
his
academic
work
was
beyond
reproach
,
but
some
academics
balked
at
his
attempt
to
condense
a
survey
of
roman
literature
into
<integer>
pages
,
and
felt
(
in
the
words
of
one
reviewer
)
that
``
even
the
most
learned

gifted
of
historians
should
observe
a

.
the

would
keep
cavilling

the

kept
buying.

only
a
small
percentage
of

titov
(
russian

титов
;
<day>
–
<day>
)
was
a
soviet
cosmonaut
who
,
on
<day>
,
became
the
second
human
to
orbit
the
earth
,
aboard
vostok
<integer>
,
preceded
by
yuri
gagarin
on
vostok
<integer>.
he
was
the
fourth
person
in
space
,
counting
suborbital
voyages
of
us
astronauts
alan
shepard
and
gus
grissom.
a
month
short
of
<integer>
years
old
at
launch
,
he
was
the
youngest
person
to
fly
in
space
until
<year>
when
oliver
daemen
flew
on
blue
origin
ns<integer>
at
the
age
of
<integer>.
since
daemen
flew
a
suborbital
mission
,
titov
remains
the
youngest
man
to
fly
in
earth
orbit.
titov
's
flight
finally
proved
that
humans
could
live
and
work
in
space.
he
was
the
first
person
to
orbit
the
earth
multiple
times
(
a
total
of
<integer>
)
,
the
first
to
pilot
a
spaceship
and
to
spend
more
than
a
day
in
space.
he
was
also
the
first
to
sleep
in
orbit
and
to
suffer
from
space
sickness
(
becoming
the
first
person
to
vomit
in
space
)
.titov
was
the
first
photographer
from
space
:
he
made
the
first
manual
photographs
from
orbit
,
thus
setting
a
record
for
modern
first
photos
of
earth
from
space.
he
also
was
the
first
person
to
film
the
earth
using
a
professional
quality
konvas-avtomat
movie
camera
,
which
he
used
for
ten
minutes.in
his
subsequent
life
titov
continued
to
work
for
the
soviet
space
program
,
and
played
a
major
role
in
the
spiral
project
where
he
trained
to
become
the
first
pilot
of
an
orbital
spaceplane.
however
,
after
the
death
of
yuri
gagarin
in
a
military
aircraft
accident
in
<year>
,
the
soviet
government
decided
it
could
not
afford
to
lose
its
second
cosmonaut
,
and
so
titov
's
career
as
test
pilot
ended.
titov
served
in
the
soviet
air
force
,
attaining
the
rank
of
colonel-general.
in
his
final
years
in
post-soviet
russia
he
became
a
communist
politician.
despite
having
been
chosen
second
,
after
gagarin
,
to
fly
into
space
,
it
was
titov
who
later
proposed
the
soviet
government
regularly
celebrate
cosmonautics
day
on
april
<integer>
,
the
day
of
gagarin
's
flight.
==
biography
==
titov
was
born
in
the
village
of
verkhneye
zhilino
in
the
altai
krai
and
went
to
school
at
the
stalingrad
military
aviation
school.
after
graduating
as
an
air
force
pilot
,
he
was
selected
for
cosmonaut
training
in
<year>.
he
flew
the
vostok
<integer>
mission
launched
on
<day>.
it
lasted
for
<decimal>
hours
and
he
performed
<integer>
orbits
of
the
earth.
his
call
sign
was
eagle
(
russian
:
орёл
)
.
he
landed
close
to
the
town
of
krasny
kut
in
saratov
oblast
,
russia.
a
month
short
of
<integer>
years
old
at
launch
,
he
remained
the
youngest
person
to
fly
in
space
until
july
of
<year>
,
when
his
record
was
surpassed
by
a
dutch
teenager
,
oliver
daemen.
titov
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
of
the
soviet
union
,
as
were
almost
all
the
soviet
cosmonauts.
titov
was
a
fine
sportsman
,
and
keen
on
gymnastics
:
service
in
the
air
force
made
us
strong
,
both
physically
and
morally.
all
of
us
cosmonauts
took
up
sports
and
pt
seriously
when
we
served
in
the
air
force.
i
know
that
yuri
gagarin
was
fond
of
ice
hockey.
he
liked
to
play
goal
keeper.
gherman
titov
was
a
gymnastics
enthusiast
,
andriyan
nikolayev
liked
skiing
,
pavel
popovich
went
in
for
weight
lifting.
i
do
n't
think
i
am
wrong
when
i
say
that
sports
became
a
fixture
in
the
life
of
the
cosmonauts.
he
was
the
first
person
to
suffer
from
space
sickness
(
motion
sickness
in
space
)
and
was
also
the
first
person
to
sleep
in
space.
he
slept
for
roughly
one
orbit
and
was
surprised
to
wake
with
his
arms
floating
in
the
air
because
of
the
absence
of
normal
gravity.
he
returned
to
sleep
after
he
had
his
arms
under
a
security
belt
and
slept
<integer>
minutes
more
than
predicted
by
the
flight
plan.
he
stated
,
``
once
you
have
your
arms
and
legs
arranged
properly
,
space
sleep
is
fine
...
.
i
slept
like
a
baby
''
.
though
he
had
been
suffering
from
space
sickness
during
his
orbit
,
titov
celebrated
upon
landing.
his
celebration
is
described
as
``
a
fit
of
euphoria
''
after
landing
,
and
on
his
return
flight
to
kubishev
for
debriefing
,
he
alarmed
the
medical
staff
by
opening
and
downing
a
beer
,
in
complete
violation
of
the
rules.after
landing
,
titov
was
sent
to
hospital
for
further
testing
to
ensure
that
he
was
not
sick.
after
his
mission
,
he
reportedly
engaged
in
behaviours
that
could
be
considered
unacceptable
for
someone
working
within
the
space
programme.
he
is
reported
to
have
been
enthralled
in
his
love
of
women
,
excessive
drinking
,
and
fast
cars
,
which
caused
some
to
theorise
that
his
behaviour
had
potentially
been
another
side
effect
of
the
space
sickness
he
experienced
from
zero
gravity.
further
testing
revealed
that
not
to
be
the
case.during
a
widely-publicised
<year>
visit
to
seattle
to
tour
the
century
<integer>
world
's
fair
,
titov
was
asked
by
reporters
how
his
space
flight
affected
his
philosophy
of
life.
he
replied
:
``
sometimes
people
are
saying
that
god
is
out
there.
i
was
looking
around
attentively
all
day
but
i
did
n't
find
anybody
there.
i
saw
neither
angels
nor
god
''
.
the
utterance
was
used
in
soviet
anti-religion
propaganda
,
but
it
was
misattributed
to
yuri
gagarin.following
his
space
flight
,
titov
assumed
various
senior
positions
in
the
soviet
space
programme
until
his
retirement
in
<year>.
in
<year>
,
he
was
elected
to
the
state
duma
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party
of
the
russian
federation.
he
died
of
cardiac
arrest
in
his
sauna
at
the
age
of
<integer>
in
moscow.
he
was
buried
in
the
novodevichy

(

===
taviani
was
born
in

on

<year>.
his
mother
,
elide
banchelli
,
was
an
elementary
school
teacher.
his
father
,
ferdinando
,
was
a
headmaster
and
one
of
the
founders
of
the
genoese
section
of
the
italian
people
's
party
(
<year>
)
.
after
graduating
from

classical
“liceo”

taviani
went
on
to

where
he
earned
a
law
degree
in

the

he
obtained
his

and
began

===
resistance
(
<year>–<year>
)
===
already
in
secondary
school
taviani
joined
the
catholic
group
that
was
most
sensitive
to
social
issues.
at
university
he
became
head
of
the
genoese
branch
of
fuci
(
federazione
universitaria
dei
cattolici
italiani
)
.
following
the
lateran
pacts
,
taviani
,
a
young
man
at
the
time
,
shared
in
the
illusion
that
fascism
might
one
day
evolve
into
a
movement
for
social
justice
inspired
by
catholic
values.
consequently
,
at
the
age
of
<integer>
he
joined
the
pnf.
but
the
fascists’
belligerent
policies
and
,
above
all
,
the
racial
laws
of
<year>
shattered
that
illusion.
by
the
eve
of
the
war
,
taviani
was
firmly
in
the
camp
of
the
anti-fascists.
on
july
<integer>
,
<year>
just
before
the
fall
of
the
regime
,
taviani
founded
in
liguria
the
section
of
the
“partito-cristiano-sociale
democratico”
(
later
christian
democracy
,
dc
)
bringing
together
young
people
from
the
christian
social
movement
with
the
older
members
of
the
people
's
party.
immediately
after
september
<integer>
(
under
the
pseudonym
of
riccardo
pittaluga
)
taviani
founded
the
committee
for
national
liberation
in
liguria
(
clnl
)
as
representative
of
the
christian
democracy.
his
clandestine
activities
often
brought
him
among
the
partisans
in
the
mountains
(
it
was
in
these
years
that
he
became
close
friends
with
the
commanders
aldo
gastaldi
,
“bisagno”
and
aurelio
ferrando
,
“scrivia”
)
.
taviani
maintained
contacts
with
allied
military
missions
that
had
parachuted
behind
enemy
lines.
he
was
also
editor
of
la
voce
d’italia
a
banned
periodical
published
by
the
resistance
in
liguria.
within
the
clnl
taviani
often
argued
the
need
for
a
single
military
command
that
could
effectively
coordinate
the
efforts
of
volunteers
from
so
many
different
political
backgrounds.
on
the
night
of
april
<integer>
,
<year>
the
clnl
assumed
the
leadership
of
the
insurrection
in
genoa.
on
the
evening
of
april
<integer>
the
german
commander
surrendered
to
representatives
of
the
clnl.
the
next
morning
it
was
taviani
who
announced
that
the
city
had
been
liberated
in
a
radio
address
broadcast
by
the
bbc
:
“genoa

,
taviani
supported

,
though
always
from
a
pro-european
perspective.
he
was
one
of
the
most
stubborn
supporters
of
the
ecsc
,
the

and
finally
the

as

favoured

<year>
until
<year>
taviani
was
minister
in

as
minister
of
the
interior
he
was
active
in
the
struggle
against
the

and
effectively
countered
both
the
neo-fascists
(

outlawed

by
the

,
the
on
and
the
br.
===
social
christianity
,
support
for
nato
and
opening
up
to
the
left
===
in
the
eyes
of
conservatives
taviani’s
contribution
to
the
italian
constitution
and
his
book
la
proprietà
made
him
appear
to
be
too
close
to
socialist
ideas.
but
during
the
first
years
of
the
cold
war
taviani
was
one
of
the
firmest
supporters
of
nato
which
he
viewed
as
the
only
possible
guarantee
of
italy’s
security.
this
position
drew
criticism
from
socialists
and
communists.
in
the
early
<year>s
taviani
favoured
an
alliance
between
the
christian
democrats
and
the
socialist
party
in
the
regional
government
of
liguria
which
he
later
supported
for
years
in
national
governments.
in
<year>
he
firmly
refused
to
accept
a
proposal
by
italy’s
president
antonio
segni
to
head
an
emergency
government
as
an
authoritarian
crack
down
on
the
communists.
in
the
years
that
followed
taviani
was
severely
criticised
by
supporters
of
the
political
right.
after
the
coup
d’état
in
chile
,
taviani
recognised
the
change
that
took
place
in
the
italian
communist
party
under
enrico
berlinguer.
during
his
final
period
as
minister
of
the
interior
he
expressed
appreciation
of
the
aid
the
pci
provided
in
countering
illegal
armed
organisations
(
both
from
the
right
and
left
wings
)
.
by
the
end
of
<year>
taviani’s
position
within
the
christian
democratic
party
had
become
difficult
because
many
felt
he
was
too
far
to
the
left.
taviani
refused
offers
to
compromise
and
thereafter
only
accepted
institutional
appointments
but
never
again
took
up
a
post
in
the
government.

in

taviani
became

(
in

.
in

of

he
expressed
the
hope
that
the

would
join

ideology

taviani’s
economic
thought
belongs
to
a
current
of

his

taviani
developed
the
idea
of
a
“mixed”
economy

a
“third
way”
which
would
be
capable
of
promoting
social
justice
while
getting
beyond
the
opposition
between
capitalism
and
socialism.
an
important
event
for
taviani
was
his

was
an
eminent
british
economist
,
educated
at
westminster
school
and
cambridge
university
(
caius
and
king
's
)
.
in
<year>
he
received
the
nobel
memorial
prize
in
economic
sciences
for
developing
an
accounting
model
that
could
be
used
to
track
economic
activities
on

,
later
,
an

scale.
==
early
life
==
richard
stone
was
born
in
london
,
uk
on
<day>.
he
received
an
english
upper
middle
class
education
when
he
was
a
child
as
he
attended
cliveden
place
and
westminster
school.
however
,
he
had
not
been
taught
mathematics
and
science
until
secondary
school.
when
he
was
<integer>
years
old
,
he
followed
his
father
to
india
as
his
father
was
appointed
as
a
judge
in
madras.
from
india
,
he
visited
many
asian
countries
:
malaya
,
singapore
,
and
indonesia.
after
travelling
for
one
year
,
he
went
back
to
london
and
studied
at
gonville
and
caius
college
,
cambridge
in
<year>
,
where
he
studied
law
for
two
years.
the
young
stone
then
changed
to
reading
economics.
he
was
interested
in
economics
as
he
thought
that
``
if
there
were
more
economists
,
the
world
would
be
a
better
place
''
.
during
the
great
slump
of
the
<year>s
,
the
of
unemployment
was
very
high
and
it
motivated
him
to
know
what
caused
it
and
how
to
overcome
it.
he
faced
a
challenge
from
his
parents
as
they
were
disappointed
to
his
choice.
however
,
stone
was
very
enthusiastic
to
be
an
economist
and
then
enjoyed
his
time
studying
economics.
at
his
new
major
,
he
got
supervision
from
richard
kahn
and
gerald
shove.
however
,
stone
's
quantitative
mind
had
been
greatly
influenced
by
colin
clark
,
stone
's
teacher
in
statistics
at
cambridge.
clark
then
introduced
stone
to
his
project
in
measuring
the
national
income.
this
project
then
brought
the
greatest
name
for
stone
as
he
received
nobel
prize
because
of
this
topic.
after
their
meeting
at
cambridge
,
stone
and
clark
then
became
best
friends.
==
career
==
after
graduating
from
cambridge
in
<year>
and
until
world
war
ii
he
worked
at
lloyd
's
of
london.
during
the
war
,
stone
worked
with
james
meade
as
a
statistician
and
economist
for
the
british
government.
at
the
government
's
request
they
analyzed
the
uk
's
economy
related
to
the
current
total
resources
of
the
nation
for
the
war
time.
it
was
at
this
time
that
they
developed
the
early
versions
of
the
system
of
national
accounts.
their
work
resulted
in
the
u.k.
's
first
national
accounts
in
<year>.
the
collaboration
between
stone
and
meade
was
over
after
<year>
as
their
office
was
split
into
two
different
ones.
they
then
worked
separately
,
meade
being
responsible
for
the
economic
section
and
stone
,
for
the
national
income.
in
his
new
office
,
the
central
statistical
office
,
stone
became
john
maynard
keynes
'
assistant.
stone
left
working
for
the
government
when
the
war
ended
in
<year>.
after
the
war
,
stone
took
up
an
academic
career
when
he
worked
at
cambridge
as
the
director
of
the
new
department
of
applied
economics
(
<year>–<year>
)
.
as
the
director
,
stone
made
the
department
focus
on
research
programmes
about
economic
theory
and
statistical
methodology.
this
strategy
attracted
many
top
economists
in
that
era
to
join
the
department.
some
remarkable
works
at
the
department
were
,
for
example
,
durbin
and
watson
on
testing
serial
correlation
in
econometrics
,
and
alan
prest
and
derek
rowe
on
demand
analysis.
this
condition
made
dae
become
one
of
the
leading
quantitative
economic
research
centres
in
the
world
in
his
era.
stone
himself
had
many
projects
in
dae
:
national
accounting
where
he
had
employed
agatha
chapman
as
a
research
associate
,
the
analysis
of
consumer
demand
,
and
the
system
of
socio-demographic
account.
in
<year>
,
stone
gave
up
his
directorship
at
the
department
as
he
was
appointed
as
the
p.d.
leake
chair
of
finance
and
accounting
at
cambridge
(
emeritus
from
<year>
)
.
together
with
j.a.c.
brown
he
began
the
cambridge
growth
project
,
which
developed
the
cambridge
multisectoral
dynamic
model
of
the
british
economy
(
mdm
)
.
in
building
the
cambridge
growth
project
,
they
used
social
accounting
matrices
(
sam
)
,
which
also
formed
computable
equilibrium
model
which
then
developed
at
the
world
bank.
he
was
succeeded
as
leader
of
the
cambridge
growth
project
by
terry
barker.
in
<year>
,
stone
was
appointed
as
the
chairman
of
the
faculty
board
of
economics
and
politics
for
the
next
two
years.
a
company
founded
by
members
of
the
department
and
limited
by
guarantee
,
cambridge
econometrics
,
was
founded
in
<year>
with
stone
as
its
first
honorary
president.
the
company
continues
to
develop
mdm
and
to
use
the
model
to
make
economic
forecasts.
before
retiring
from
cambridge
in
<year>
,
stone
served
as
the
president
of
the
royal
economic
society
for
<year>–<year>.
==
achievements
==
stone
in
<year>
received
the
nobel
memorial
prize
in
economic
sciences
for
developing
an
accounting
model
that
could
be
used
to
track
economic
activities
on
a
national
and
,
later
,
an
international
scale.
while
he
was
not
the
first
economist
to
work
in
this
field
,
he
was
the
first
to
do
so
with
double
entry
accounting.
double
entry
accounting
basically
states
that
every
income
item
on
one
side
of
the
balance
sheet
must
be
met
by
an
expenditure
item
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
accounting
sheet
therefore
creating
a
system
of
balance.
this
double
entry
system
is
the
basis
of
nearly
all
modern
accounting
today.
this
allowed
for
a
reliable
way
of
tracking
trade
and
wealth
transfer
on
a
global
scale.
he
is
sometimes
known
as
the
'father
of
national
income
accounting
'
,
and
is
the
author
of
studies
of
consumer
demand
statistics
and
demand
modeling
,
economic
growth
,
and
input-output.during
his
acceptance
speech
stone
mentioned
françois
quesnay
as
well
as
the
tableau
économique.
stone
stated
that
it
was
one
of
the
first
works
in
economics
to
examine
various
sectors
on
such
a
global
level
and
how
they
are
all
interconnected.
==

in

was
booked
to
appear
in
a
segment
with
the
truth
commission
where
he
was
to
be
beaten
and
dragged
up
the
entrance
ramp.
unbeknownst
to
wwf
management
,
johnson
's
sister
-
an
avid
fan
of
wwf
-
was
battling
cancer.
johnson
knew
his
sister
watched
wwf
each
week
and
did
n't
want
her
to
have
the
image
of
her
brother
being
beaten
and
dragged
by
the
neck
while
she
was
gravely
ill.
according
to
johnson
,
<integer>
minutes
before
he
was
scheduled
for
the
match
which
would
end
in
his
being
attacked
,
he
received
a
call
that
his
sister
was
``
doing
really
bad
''
and
that
he
should
come
immediately
to
her
hospital
in
florida.
johnson
then
met
with
vince
mcmahon
and
told
him
he
``
had
some
things
to
deal
with
''
and
immediately
left
wwf
and
flew
to
florida
,
where
his
sister
died
the
following
week.
johnson
has
stated
subsequently
that
he
did
not
tell
wwf
management
the
reason
for
his
departure
at
the
time
because
he
``
did
n't
like
to
burden
people
with
his
problems
''
and
did
n't
want
to
give
the
impression
that
he
was
``
telling
them
something
for
sympathy
''
.
in
a
july
<year>
interview
,
johnson
for
the
first
time
also
made
claims
that
racism
was
another
reason
for
his
departure
saying
``
there
was
a
family
issue
that
needed
my
attention
,
but
,
on
top
of
that
,
there
were
other
things
going
on
behind
scenes
that
didn’t
sit
right
with
me.
i
started
noting
a
lot
of
racism
going
on.
it
called
me
not
wanting
to
be
there

back
off

was
a

educator
and
philosopher
who
was
a
leading
advocate
of
critical

his
influential
work
pedagogy
of
the

is
generally
considered
one
of
the
foundational
texts
of
the
critical

movement
,
and

biography
==
freire
was
born
on
<day>
to
a
middle-class
family
in
recife
,
the
capital
of
the
northeastern
brazilian
state
of
pernambuco.
he
became
familiar
with
poverty
and
hunger
from
an
early
age
as
a
result
of
the
great
depression.
in
<year>
his
family
moved
to
the
more
affordable
city
of
jaboatão
dos
guararapes
,
<integer>
km
west
of
recife.
his
father
died
on
<day>.during
his
childhood
and
adolescence
,
freire
ended
up
four
grades
behind
,
and
his
social
life
revolved
around
playing
pick-up
football
with
other
poor
children
,
from
whom
he
claims
to
have
learned
a
great
deal.
these
experiences
would
shape
his
concerns
for
the
poor
and
would
help
to
construct
his
particular
educational
viewpoint.
freire
stated
that
poverty
and
hunger
severely
affected
his
ability
to
learn.
these
experiences
influenced
his
decision
to
dedicate
his
life
to
improving
the
lives
of
the
poor
:
``
i
did
n't
understand
anything
because
of
my
hunger.
i
was
n't
dumb.
it
was
n't
lack
of
interest.
my
social
condition
did
n't
allow
me
to
have
an
education.
experience
showed
me
once
again
the
relationship
between
social
class
and
knowledge
''
.
eventually
,
his
family
's
misfortunes
turned
around
and
their
prospects
improved.freire
enrolled
in
law
school
at
the
university
of
recife
in
<year>.
he
also
studied
philosophy
,
more
specifically
phenomenology
,
and
the
psychology
of
language.
although
admitted
to
the
legal
bar
,
he
never
practiced
law
and
instead
worked
as
a
secondary
school
portuguese
teacher.
in
<year>
,
he
married
elza
maia
costa
de
oliveira
,
a
fellow
teacher.
the
two
worked
together
and
had
five
children.in
<year>
,
freire
was
appointed
director
of
the
pernambuco
department
of
education
and
culture.
working
primarily
among
the
illiterate
poor
,
freire
began
to
develop
an
educational
praxis
that
would
have
an
influence
on
the
liberation
theology
movement
of
the
<year>s.
in
<year>s
brazil
,
literacy
was
a
requirement
for
voting
in
presidential
elections.
in
<year>
,
he
was
appointed
director
of
the
department
of
cultural
extension
at
the
university
of
recife.
in
<year>
,
he
had
the
first
opportunity
for
large-scale
application
of
his
theories
,
when
,
in
an
experiment
,
<integer>
sugarcane
harvesters
were
taught
to
read
and
write
in
just
<integer>
days.
in
response
to
this
experiment
,
the
brazilian
government
approved
the
creation
of
thousands
of
cultural
circles
across
the
country.the
<year>
brazilian
coup
d'état
put
an
end
to
freire
's
literacy
effort
,
as
the
ruling
military
junta
did
not
endorse
it.
freire
was
subsequently
imprisoned
as
a
traitor
for
<integer>
days.
after
a
brief
exile
in
bolivia
,
freire
worked
in
chile
for
five
years
for
the
christian
democratic
agrarian
reform
movement
and
the
united
nations
food
and
agriculture
organization.
in
<year>
,
freire
published
his
first
book
,
education
as
the
practice
of
freedom.
he
followed
it
up
with
his
most
famous
work
,
pedagogy
of
the
oppressed
,
which
was
first
published
in
<year>.
after
a
positive
international
reception
of
his
work
,
freire
was
offered
a
visiting
professorship
at
harvard
university
in
<year>.
the
next
year
,
pedagogy
of
the
oppressed
was
published
in
spanish
and
english
,
vastly
expanding
its
reach.
because
of
political
feuds
between
freire
,
a
christian
socialist
,
and
brazil
's
successive
right-wing
authoritarian
military
governments
,
the
book
went
unpublished
in
brazil
until
<year>
,
when
,
starting
with
the
presidency
of
ernesto
geisel
,
the
military
junta
started
a
process
of
slow
and
controlled
political
liberalisation.following
a
year
in
cambridge
,
massachusetts
,
freire
moved
to
geneva
to
work
as
a
special
education
advisor
to
the
world
council
of
churches.
during
this
time
freire
acted
as
an
advisor
on
education
reform
in
several
former
portuguese
colonies
in
africa
,
particularly
guinea-bissau
and
mozambique.
in
<year>
,
he
first
visited
brazil
after
more
than
a
decade
of
exile
,
eventually
moving
back
in
<year>.
freire
joined
the
workers
'
party
(
pt
)
in
são
paulo
and
acted
as
a
supervisor
for
its
adult
literacy
project
from
<year>
to

when
the
workers
'
party
won
the
<year>
são

mayoral
elections
in

freire
was
appointed
municipal

==
pedagogy
==
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
neutral
education
process.
education
either
functions
as
an
instrument
which
is
used
to
facilitate
the
integration
of
generations
into
the
logic
of
the
present
system
and
bring
about
conformity
to
it
,
or
it
becomes
the
``
practice
of
freedom
''
,
the
means
by
which
men
and
women
deal
critically
with
reality
and
discover
how
to
participate
in
the
transformation
of
their
world.
paulo
freire
contributed
a
philosophy
of
education
which
blended
classical
approaches
stemming
from
plato
and
modern
marxist
,
post-marxist
,
and
anti-colonialist
thinkers.
his
pedagogy
of
the
oppressed
(
<year>
)
can
be
read
as
an
extension
of
,
or
reply
to
,
frantz
fanon
's
the
wretched
of
the
earth
(
<year>
)
,
which
emphasized
the
need
to
provide
native
populations
with
an
education
which
was
simultaneously
new
and
modern
,
rather
than
traditional
,
and
anti-colonial
–
not
simply
an
extension
of
the
colonizing
culture.
in
pedagogy
of
the
oppressed
,
freire
,
reprising
the
oppressors–oppressed
distinction
,
applies
the
distinction
to
education
,
championing
that
education
should
allow
the
oppressed
to
regain
their
sense
of
humanity
,
in
turn
overcoming
their
condition.
nevertheless
,
he
acknowledges
that
for
this
to
occur
,
the
oppressed
individual
must
play
a
role
in
their
liberation.
no
pedagogy
which
is
truly
liberating
can
remain
distant
from
the
oppressed
by
treating
them
as
unfortunates
and
by
presenting
for
their
emulation
models
from
among
the
oppressors.
the
oppressed
must
be
their
own
example
in
the
struggle
for
their
redemption.
likewise
,
oppressors
must
be
willing
to
rethink
their
way
of
life
and
to
examine
their
own
role
in
oppression
if
true
liberation
is
to
occur
:
``
those
who
authentically
commit
themselves
to
the
people
must
re-examine
themselves
constantly
''
.freire
believed
education
could
not
be
divorced
from
politics
;
the
act
of
teaching
and
learning
are
considered
political
acts
in
and
of
themselves.
freire
defined
this
connection
as
a
main
tenet
of
critical
pedagogy.
teachers
and
students
must
be
made
aware
of
the
politics
that
surround
education.
the
way
students
are
taught
and
what
they
are
taught
serves
a
political
agenda.
teachers
,
themselves
,
have
political
notions
they
bring
into
the
classroom.
freire
believed
that
education
makes
sense
because
women
and
men
learn
that
through
learning
they
can
make
and
remake
themselves
,
because
women
and
men
are
able
to
take
responsibility
for
themselves
as
beings
capable
of
knowing—of
knowing
that
they
know
and
knowing
that
they
don't.
===
criticism
of
the
``
banking
model
''
of
education
===
in
terms
of
pedagogy
,
freire
is
best
known
for
his
attack
on
what
he
called
the
``
banking
''
concept
of
education
,
in
which
students
are
viewed
as
empty
accounts
to
be
filled
by
teachers.
he
notes
that
``
it
transforms
students
into
receiving
objects
[
and
]
attempts
to
control
thinking
and
action
,
lead
[
ing
]
men
and
women
to
adjust
to
the
world
,
inhibit
[
ing
]
their
creative
power.
''
the
basic
critique
was
not
entirely
novel
,
and
paralleled
jean-jacques
rousseau
's
conception
of
children
as
active
learners
,
as
opposed
to
a
tabula
rasa
view
,
more
akin
to
the
banking
model.
john
dewey
was
also
strongly
critical
of
the
transmission
of
mere
facts
as
the
goal
of
education.
dewey
often
described
education
as
a
mechanism
for
social
change
,
stating
that
``
education
is
a
regulation
of
the
process
of
coming
to
share
in
the
social
consciousness
;
and
that
the
adjustment
of
individual
activity
on
the
basis
of
this
social
consciousness
is
the
only
sure
method
of
social
reconstruction
''
.
freire
's
work
revived
this
view
and
placed
it
in
context
with
contemporary
theories
and
practices
of
education
,
laying
the
foundation
for
what
would
later
be
termed
critical
pedagogy.
===
culture
of
silence
===
according
to
freire
,
unequal
social
relations
create
a
``
culture
of
silence
''
that
instill
a
negative
,
passive
and
suppressed
self-image
onto
the
oppressed
,
and
learners
must
,
then
,
develop
a
critical
consciousness
in
order
to
recognize
that
this
culture
of
silence
is
created
to
oppress.
a
culture
of
silence
can
also
cause
the
``
dominated
individuals
[
to
]
lose
the
means
by
which
to
critically
respond
to
the
culture
that
is
forced
on
them
by
a
dominant
culture.
''
he
considers
social
,
race
and
class
dynamics
to
be
interlaced
into
the
conventional
education
system
,
through
which
this
culture
of
silence
eliminates
the
``
paths
of
thought
that
lead
to
a
language
of
critique.

his

van

grew
up
in
italy
,
and
following
his
education
began
a
life
in

in

secure
admission
to
the

graduated
with

economics.
the

year
,
van
den

met
the
political
philosopher
sidney
hook.
his
friendship
with
hook
forever
changed
van
den

,
converting
him
from
being
a
left-wing
activist
and
communist
,
to
the
opposite
end
of
the
spectrum
;
van
den
haag
was
now
a
conservative.
over
the
years
,
van
den
haag
took
particular
interest
in
the
field
of
capital
punishment
and
the
death
penalty.
his
book
punishing
criminals
:
concerning
a
very
old
and
painful
question
(
<year>
)
developed
his
reputation
on
being
one
of
the
foremost
thinkers
and
proponents
on
the
death
penalty.
van
den
haag
was
considered
by
his
colleagues
to
be
an
expert
on
the
issue
of
capital
punishment.van
den
haag
died
in
mendham

on

was
an

critic

behind
the
supreme
court

decision
in
brown
v.
board
of
education
which
found
segregation
in
schools
unconstitutional
,
and
testified
in
favor
of
segregation.
he
also
argued
in
print
that
continued
school
segregation
was
desirable
because
of
the
genetic
intellectual
inferiority
of
africans.
in
an
article
in
the
pages
of
the
national
review
,
one
given
pride
of
place
on
the
magazine
's
front
cover
,
van
den
haag
dismissed
recent
research
debunking
innate
ethnic
differences
in
intelligence
,
and
stated
that
he
himself
believed
such
differences
to
exist
and
to
account
for
``
much
''
of
the
poorer
academic
performance
of
black
students
,
and
that
such
differences
necessitated
separate
schooling.
this
article
in
fact
caused
quite
a
shock
among
the
readers
of
the
national
review
,
several
of
whom
wrote
angry
letters
against
the
decision
to
print
such
``
bigotry.
''
in
<year>
,
he
testified
before
the
international
court
of
justice
in
support
of
apartheid
in
south
africa.
==
on
race-neutrality
in
u.s.
immigration
policy
==
in
another
article
,
from
<year>
,
he
criticized
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
<year>
,
which
replaced
an
immigration
system
largely
excluding
asians
and
discriminating
against
southern
and
eastern
europeans
with
a
race-neutral
program
based
on
skills
and
family
connections
to
u.s.
citizens
and
permanent
residents
,
which
enabled
an
increase
in
immigration
from
asia.
van
den
haag
instead
advocated
greater
rather
than
less
immigration
restriction.
he
also
expressly
defended
the
practice
of
fashioning
immigration
policies
in
favor
of
european
ethnicity
,
arguing
that
``
the
wish
to
preserve
...
the
identity
of
one
's
nation
requires
no
justification.
''
he
likened
such
a
practice
to
a
harmless
expression
of
sentiment
,
similar
to
preferring
to
associate
with
one
's
own
family
rather
than
strangers.
``
the
wish
not
to
see
one
's
country
overrun
by
groups
one

as
alien
need
not
be
based
on
feelings
of
superiority
or
'racism.

''
==
on
the
death
penalty
==
van
den
haag’s
particular
field
of
interest
,
the
field
he
contributed
the
most
to
in
terms
of
publications
,
was
the
death
penalty.
van
den
haag
was
a
respected
debater
,
and
when
he
was
not
contributing
to
the
national
review
or
other
publications
,
he
was
active
in
debating
the
issue
of
the
death
penalty.
his
main
argument
in
its
defense
stemmed
from
key
themes
such
as
deterrence
,
and
punishment
for
severe
criminals.van
den
haag’s
ideology
is
clearly
conservative
;
in
his
book
punishing
criminals
,
he
defines
the
primary
role
of
government
as
“securing
rights
and
duties
by
specifying
them
through
laws
and
enforcing
the
laws.”
van
den
haag
believed
the
paramount
duty
of
government
is
to
“provide
legal
order
in
which
citizens
can
be
secure
in
their
lives
,
their
liberties
,
and
their
pursuit
of
happiness.”
the
law
exists
to
provide
legal
order.
van
den
haag
disputed
claims
that
capital
punishment
is
just
a
form
of
legal
retribution
by
claiming
that
if
laws
are
knowingly
broken
,
legal
order
can
only
be
maintained
by
enforcement.
justice
,
van
den
haag
claimed
,
is
blindfolded
,
while
retribution
carries
the
weight
of
passion
behind
it
;
justice
being
delivered
to
someone
who
violates
social
order
knowingly
is
equal
,
thus
the
term
legal
retribution
is
void.van
den
haag
also
argued
that
people
commit
crimes
because
they
believe
,
one
way
or
another
,
they
will
benefit
from
committing
the
crime.
thus
it
is
society’s
duty
to
make
all
crimes
as
disadvantageous
as
possible.
van
den
haag
uses
economic
examples
to
further
prove
his
point.
in
economics
,
there
is
a
concept
named
opportunity
cost.
opportunity
cost
forces
an
individual
to
weigh
the
benefits
versus
the
sacrifices
of
making
a
decision.
van
den
haag
believes
people
look
at
committing
the
crime
the
same
way
they
would
view
an
opportunity
;
they
would
weigh
the
profits
versus
the
punishment.
temptation
to
commit
a
crime
will
be
significantly
decreased
if
the
punishment
for
committing
the
crime
is
more
severe.
the
death
penalty
offers
the
greatest
weighted
punishment
for
committing
an
offense.
van
den
haag
also
related
marxist
theory
behind
his
justification
of
the
death
penalty.
marxists
,
van
den
haag
argued
,
believe
that
“legal
justice
never
can
do
less
,
though
it
can
do
more.”
legal
justice
should
distribute
punishment
equally
among
violators
and
more
frequently
in
order
to
deter
crime.
van
den
haag
also
related
to
the
marxist
belief
in
class
warfare.
van
den
haag
states
,
“obviously
,
the
poor
and
powerless
are
more
tempted
to
take
what
is
not
theirs
,
or
to
rebel
,
than
the
powerful
and
wealthy
,
who
need
not
take
what
they
already
have.”
the
threat
of
severe
punishment
diminishes
temptation
,
which
van
den
haag
argued
is
to
be
the
greatest
use
of
the
death
penalty
,
deterrence.
van
den
haag
also
believed
that
law
breakers
have
more
of
an
inclination
to
do
it
again.
breaking
the
law
leads
to
a
form
of
moral
decay
when
eventually
offenders
no
longer
can
distinguish
right
from
wrong
,
thus
repeat
offending
is
a
common
occurrence.
his
response
to
this
was
,
“the
only
permanent
,
and
irrevocable
incapacitation
is
execution.”
van
den
haag
believed
that
any
temporary
or
permanent
incapacitation
only
reduces
the
crime
rate
if
there
are
no
more
compensating
increases
in
crime
by
other
people.
however
,
if
no
strong
deterrents
such
as
the
death
penalty
existed
,
an
increase
in
crime
and
criminals
will
still
be
a
factor.
van
den
haag
believed
homicide
to
be
the
most
deplorable
crime
a
human
being
can
commit.
van
den
haag
,
in
his
book
the
death
penalty
:
a
debate
,
argues
that
“the
state
must
teach
that
killing
anyone
deliberately
,
for
whatever
reason
,
is
needless
and
wrong.”van
den
haag
believed
that
capital
punishment
has
a
direct
correlation
with
a
decrease
in
murders.
rehabilitation
as
a
response
to
murdering
criminals
is
not
an
option
because
,
as
van
den
haag
states
,
“no
effective
method
to
achieve
it
[
rehabilitation
]
has
been
found.”
if
a
proper
method
of
rehabilitation
can
be
found
,
it
would
not
reduce
the
crime
rate
,
because
rehabilitation
only
works
after
the
crime
has
been
committed.
deterrence
is
the
only
thing
that
can
have
any
effect
on
the
actual
crime
rate.
overall
,
van
den
haag
directed
his
argument
toward
the
fact
that
the
death
penalty
ought
only
to
exist
to
protect
innocent
lives.
to
sum
up
his
entire
argument
against
his
opposition
in
one
quote
,
van
den
haag
contends
,
“i’d
rather
execute
a
man
convicted
of
having
murdered
others
than
put
the
lives
of
innocents
at
risk.
i
find
it
hard
to
understand
the
opposite
choice.”
van
den
haag
recognized
that
innocent
people
would
sometimes
be
executed.

===
cousteau
was
born
on
<day>
,
in
saint-andré-de-cubzac
,
gironde
,
france
,
to
daniel
and
élisabeth
cousteau.
he
had
one
brother
,
pierre-antoine.
cousteau
completed
his
preparatory
studies
at
the
collège
stanislas
in
paris.
in
<year>
,
he
entered
the
école
navale
and
graduated
as
a
gunnery
officer.
however
,
an
automobile
accident
,
which
broke
both
his
arms
,
cut
short
his
career
in
naval
aviation.
the
accident
forced
cousteau
to
change
his
plans
to
become
a
naval
pilot
,
so
he
then
indulged
his
passion
for
the
ocean.in
toulon
,
where
he
was
serving
on
the
condorcet
,
cousteau
carried
out
his
first
underwater
experiments
,
thanks
to
his
friend
philippe
tailliez
who
in
<year>
lent
him
some
fernez
underwater
goggles
,
predecessors
of
modern
swimming
goggles.
cousteau
also
belonged
to
the
information
service
of
the
french
navy
,
and
was
sent
on
missions
to
shanghai
and
japan
(
<year>–<year>
)
and
in
the
ussr
(
<year>
)
.on
<day>
,
he
married
simone
melchior
,
his
business
partner

with
whom
he
had
two
sons
,
jean-michel
(
born
<year>
)
and
philippe
(
<year>–<year>
)
.
his
sons
took
part
in
the
adventures
of
the
calypso.
in
<year>
,
one
year
after
his
wife
simone
's
death
from
cancer
,
he
married
francine
triplet.
they
already
had
a
daughter
diane
cousteau
(
born
<year>
)
and
a
son
,
pierre-yves
cousteau
(
born
<year>
)
,
born
during
cousteau
's
marriage
to
his
first
wife.
===
early
<year>s
:
innovation
of
modern
underwater
diving
===
the
years
of
world
war
ii
were
decisive
for
the
history
of
diving.
after
the
armistice
of
<year>
,
the
family
of
simone
and
jacques-yves
cousteau
took
refuge
in
megève
,
where
he
became
a
friend
of
the
ichac
family
who
also
lived
there.
jacques-yves
cousteau
and
marcel
ichac
shared
the
same
desire
to
reveal
to
the
general
public
unknown
and
inaccessible
places
—
for
cousteau
the
underwater
world
and
for
ichac
the
high
mountains.
the
two
neighbors
took
the
first
ex-aequo
prize
of
the
congress
of
documentary
film
in
<year>
,
for
the
first
french
underwater
film
:
par
dix-huit
mètres
de
fond
(
<integer>
meters
deep
)
,
made
without
breathing
apparatus
the
previous
year
in
the
embiez
islands
in
var
,
with
philippe
tailliez
and
frédéric
dumas
,
using
a
depth-pressure-proof
camera
case
developed
by
mechanical
engineer
léon
vèche
,
an
engineer
of
arts
and
measures
at
the
naval
college.
in
<year>
,
they
made
the
film
épaves
(
shipwrecks
)
,
in
which
they
used
two
of
the
very
first
aqua-lung
prototypes.
these
prototypes
were
made
in
boulogne-billancourt
by
the
air
liquide
company
,
following
instructions
from
cousteau
and
émile
gagnan.
when
making
épaves
,
cousteau
could
not
find
the
necessary
blank
reels
of
movie
film
,
but
had
to
buy
hundreds
of
small
still
camera
film
reels
the
same
width
,
intended
for
a
make
of
child
's
camera
,
and
cemented
them
together
to
make
long
reels.having
kept
bonds
with
the
english
speakers
(
he
spent
part
of
his
childhood
in
the
united
states
and
usually
spoke
english
)
and
with
french
soldiers
in
north
africa
(
under
admiral
lemonnier
)
,
jacques-yves
cousteau
(
whose
villa
``
baobab
''
at
sanary
(
var
)
was
opposite
admiral
darlan
's
villa
``
reine
''
)
,
helped
the
french
navy
to
join
again
with
the
allies
;
he
assembled
a
commando
operation
against
the
italian
espionage
services
in
france
,
and
received
several
military
decorations
for
his
deeds.
at
that
time
,
he
kept
his
distance
from
his
brother
pierre-antoine
cousteau
,
a
``
pen
anti-semite
''
who
wrote
the
collaborationist
newspaper
je
suis
partout
(
i
am
everywhere
)
and
who
received
the
death
sentence
in
<year>.
however
,
this
was
later
commuted
to
a
life
sentence
,
and
pierre-antoine
was
released
in
<year>.
during
the
<year>s
,
cousteau
is
credited
with
improving
the
aqua-lung
design
which
gave
birth
to
the
open-circuit
scuba
technology
used
today.
according
to
his
first
book
,
the
silent
world
:
a
story
of
undersea
discovery
and
adventure
(
<year>
)
,
cousteau
started
diving
with
fernez
goggles
in
<year>
,
and
in
<year>
used
the
self-contained
underwater
breathing
apparatus
invented
in
<year>
by
commander
yves
le
prieur.
cousteau
was
not
satisfied
with
the
length
of
time
he
could
spend
underwater
with
the
le
prieur
apparatus
so
he
improved
it
to
extend
underwater
duration
by
adding
a
demand
regulator
,
invented
in
<year>
by
émile
gagnan.
in
<year>
cousteau
tried
out
the
first
prototype
aqua-lung
which
finally
made
extended
underwater
exploration
possible.
===
late
<year>s
:
gers
and
élie
monnier
===
in
<year>
,
cousteau
and
tailliez
showed
the
film
épaves
(
``
shipwrecks
''
)
to
admiral
lemonnier
,
who
gave
them
the
responsibility
of
setting
up
the
groupement
de
recherches
sous-marines
(
grs
)
(
underwater
research
group
)
of
the
french
navy
in
toulon.
a
little
later
it
became
the
gers
(
groupe
d'études
et
de
recherches
sous-marines
,
=
underwater
studies
and
research
group
)
,
then
the
comismer
(
``
commandement
des
interventions
sous
la
mer
''
,
=
``
undersea
interventions
command
''
)
,
and
finally
more
recently
the
cephismer.
in
<year>
,
chief
petty
officer
maurice
fargues
became
the
first
diver
to
die
using
an
aqualung
,
while
attempting
a
new
depth
record
with
the
gers
near
toulon.in
<year>
,
between
missions
of
mine
clearance
,
underwater
exploration
and
technological
and
physiological
tests
,
cousteau
undertook
a
first
campaign
in
the
mediterranean
on
board
the
sloop
élie
monnier
,
with
philippe
tailliez
,
frédéric
dumas
,
jean
alinat
and
the
scenario
writer
marcel
ichac.
the
small
team
also
undertook
the
exploration
of
the
roman
wreck
of
mahdia
(
tunisia
)
.
it
was
the
first
underwater
archaeology
operation
using
autonomous
diving
,
opening
the
way
for
scientific
underwater
archaeology.
cousteau
and
marcel
ichac
brought
back
from
there
the
carnets
diving
film
(
presented
and
preceded
with
the
cannes
film
festival
<year>
)
.
cousteau
and
the
élie
monnier
then
took
part
in
the
rescue
of
professor
jacques
piccard
's
bathyscaphe
,
the
fnrs<integer>
,
during
the
<year>
expedition
to
dakar.
thanks
to
this
rescue
,
the
french
navy
was
able
to
reuse
the
sphere
of
the
bathyscaphe
to
construct
the
fnrs<integer>.
the
adventures
of
this
period
are
told
in
the
two
books
the
silent
world
(
<year>
,
by
cousteau
and
dumas
)
and
plongées
sans
câble
(
<year>
,
by
philippe
tailliez
)
.
===
<year>–<year>s
===
in
<year>
,
cousteau
left
the
french
navy.
in
<year>
,
he
founded
the
french
oceanographic
campaigns
(
foc
)
,
and
leased
a
ship
called
calypso
from
thomas
loel
guinness
for
a
symbolic
one
franc
a
year.
cousteau
refitted
the
calypso
as
a
mobile
laboratory
for
field
research
and
as
his
principal
vessel
for
diving
and
filming.
he
also
carried
out
underwater
archaeological
excavations
in
the
mediterranean
,
in
particular
at
grand-congloué
(
<year>
)
.
with
the
publication
of
his
first
book
in
<year>
,
the
silent
world
,
cousteau
correctly
predicted
the
existence
of
the
echolocation
abilities
of
porpoises.
he
reported
that
his
research
vessel
,
the
élie
monier
,
was
heading
to
the
straits
of
gibraltar
and
noticed
a
group
of
porpoises
following
them.
cousteau
changed
course
a
few
degrees
off
the
optimal
course
to
the
center
of
the
strait
,
and
the
porpoises
followed
for
a
few
minutes
,
then
diverged
toward
mid-channel
again.
it
was
evident
that
they
knew
where
the
optimal
course
lay
,
even
if
the
humans
did
not.
cousteau
concluded
that
the
cetaceans
had
something
like
sonar
,
which
was
a
relatively
new
feature
on
submarines.
in
<year>
,
cousteau
conducted
a
survey
of
abu
dhabi
waters
on
behalf
of
british
petroleum.
among
those
accompanying
him
was
louis
malle
who
made
a
black-and-white
film
of
the
expedition
for
the
company.
cousteau
won
the
palme
d'or
at
the
cannes
film
festival
in
<year>
for
the
silent
world
co-produced
with
malle.
in
<year>
,
cousteau
took
over
as
leader
of
the
oceanographic
museum
of
monaco.
afterward
,
with
the
assistance
of
jean
mollard
,
he
made
a
``
diving
saucer
''
sp<integer>
,
an
experimental
underwater
vehicle
which
could
reach
a
depth
of
<integer>
meters.
the
successful
experiment
was
quickly
repeated
in
<year>
with
two
vehicles
which
reached
<integer>
meters.
in
<year>
,
he
was
elected
as
director
of
the
oceanographical
museum
of
monaco.
he
directed
précontinent
,
about
the
experiments
of
diving
in
saturation
(
long-duration
immersion
,
houses
under
the
sea
)
,
and
was
admitted
to
the
united
states
national
academy
of
sciences.
he
was
involved
in
the
creation
of
confédération
mondiale
des
activités
subaquatiques
and
served
as
its
inaugural
president
from
<year>
to
<year>.cousteau
also
took
part
in
inventing
the
``
sp<integer>
denise
diving
saucer
''
in
<year>
which
was
an
invention
best
for
exploring
the
ocean
floor
,
as
it
allowed
one
to
explore
on
solid
ground.in
october
<year>
,
a
large
amount
of
radioactive
waste
was
going
to
be
discarded
in
the
mediterranean
sea
by
the
commissariat
à
l'énergie
atomique
(
cea
)
.
the
cea
argued
that
the
dumps
were
experimental
in
nature
,
and
that
french
oceanographers
such
as
vsevelod
romanovsky
had
recommended
it.
romanovsky
and
other
french
scientists
,
including
louis
fage
and
jacques
cousteau
,
repudiated
the
claim
,
saying
that
romanovsky
had
in
mind
a
much
smaller
amount.
the
cea
claimed
that
there
was
little
circulation
(
and
hence
little
need
for
concern
)
at
the
dump
site
between
nice
and
corsica
,
but
french
public
opinion
sided
with
the
oceanographers
rather
than
with
the
cea
atomic
energy
scientists.
the
cea
chief
,
francis
perrin
,
decided
to
postpone
the
dump.
cousteau
organized
a
publicity
campaign
which
in
less
than
two
weeks
gained
wide
popular
support.
the
train
carrying
the
waste
was
stopped
by
women
and
children
sitting
on
the
railway
tracks
,
and
it
was
sent
back
to
its
origin.
in
the
<year>s
,
cousteau
was
involved
with
a
set
of
three
projects
to
build
underwater
``
villages
''
;
the
projects
were
named
precontinent
i
,
precontinent
ii
and
precontinent
iii.
each
ensuing
project
was
aimed
at
increasing
the
depth
at
which
people
continuously
lived
under
water
,
and
were
an
attempt
at
creating
an
environment
in
which
men
could
live
and
work
on
the
sea
floor.
the
projects
are
best
known
as
conshelf
i
(
<year>
)
,
conshelf
ii
(
<year>
)
,
and
conshelf
iii
(
<year>
)
.
the
names
``
precontinent
''
,
and
``
continental
shelf
station
''
(
conshelf
)
were
used
interchangeably
by
cousteau.
a
meeting
with
american
television
companies
(
abc
,
métromédia
,
nbc
)
created
the
series
the
undersea
world
of
jacques
cousteau
,
with
the
character
of
the
commander
in
the
red
bonnet
inherited
from
standard
diving
dress
intended
to
give
the
films
a
``

''
style.

series
ran
for
ten
years
from

,
the
cousteau

in
<year>
,
he
wrote
the
book
the
shark
:
splendid
savage
of
the
sea
with
his
son
philippe.
in
this
book
,
cousteau
described
the
oceanic
whitetip
shark
as
``
the
most
dangerous
of
all
sharks
''
.
in

<year>
,
two
years

``
what

it
's
a

perhaps
not
altogether

one

if

we

it

terrible
to
have

this.

stabilized

to
do
that
we
must
eliminate
<integer>
,
<integer>
people
per

this
is
so
horrible
to
contemplate
that
we
should
n't
even
say
it.
but
the
general
situation
in
which
we
are
involved
is
lamentable

===
religious
views
===
though
he
was
not
particularly
a
religious
man
,
cousteau
believed
that
the
teachings
of
the
different
major
religions
provide
valuable
ideals
and
thoughts
to
protect
the
environment.
in
a
chapter
entitled
``

work
the
human
,

,
he
is
quoted
as
stating
that
``
the
glory
of
nature
provides
evidence
that
god
exists
''
.
===
opinion
on
recreational
fishing
===
cousteau
said
because
fish
are
cold-blooded
,
does
not
mean
they
do
not
feel
pain
,
and
that
recreational
fishermen
only
say
so
to
reassure
their
conscience.

after

<integer>th
birthday.
he
was
buried
in
the
family
vault
at
saint-andré-de-cubzac
,
his
birthplace.
an
homage
was
paid
to
him
by
the
town
by
naming
the
street
which
runs
out
to
the
house
of
his
birth
``
rue
du
commandant
cousteau
''
,
where
a
commemorative
plaque
was
placed.
cousteau
's
legacy
includes
more
than
<integer>
television
documentaries
,
more
than
<integer>
books
,
and
an
environmental
protection
foundation
with
<integer>
,
<integer>
members.cousteau
liked
to
call
himself
an
``
oceanographic
technician
''
.
he
was
,
in
reality
,
a
sophisticated
showman
,
teacher
,
and
lover
of
nature.
his
work
permitted
many
people
to
explore
the
resources
of
the
oceans.
his
work
also
created
a
new
kind
of
scientific
communication
,
criticized
at
the
time
by
some
academics.
the
so-called
``
divulgationism
''
,
a
simple
way
of
sharing
scientific
concepts
,
was
soon
employed
in
other
disciplines
and
became
one
of
the
most
important
characteristics
of
modern
television
broadcasting.
ironically
,
cousteau
's
most
lasting
legacy
may
be
a
negative
one.
his
oceanographic
museum
in
monaco
,
and
perhaps
even
he
himself
,
has
been
identified
as
introducing
the
caulerpa
``

''
which
is
destroying
much
of

currently
attempting

it
is
raising
funds
to
build

in
a
legal
battle
with
his
son
jean-michel
over
jean-michel
licensing
the
cousteau
name
for
a
south

resulting
in
jean-michel

being
ordered
by

not
to
encourage
confusion
between
his
for-profit
business
and
his
father

in

live
on
russian
television
,
then
broadcasting
from
an
emergency
station
near
moscow
,
as
there
was
fighting
going
on
in
the
ostankino
complex
,
calling
on
muscovites
to
gather
to
defend
yeltsin
's
government
so
that
russia
would
not
be
``
turned
into
an
enormous
concentration
camp
for
decades
''
.in
the
<year>
duma
elections
,
in
the
aftermath
of
the
crisis
,
gaidar
led
the
pro-government
bloc
russia
's
choice
and
was
seen
by
some
as
a
possible
future
prime
minister.
however
,
due
to
the
bloc
's
failure
to
win
the
plurality
of
votes
in
the
election
,
gaidar
's
role
in
the
government
diminished
and
he
finally
resigned
on
<day>.
during
the
<year>
nato
bombing
of
yugoslavia
yegor
gaidar
,
boris
nemtsov
and
boris
fyodorov
were
in

on

===
reforms
controversy
===
gaidar
was
often
criticized
for
imposing
ruthless
reforms
in
<year>
with
little
care
for
their
social
impact
;
however
,
it
has
to
be
understood
that
the
country
back
then
was
at
the
brink
of
a
famine.
russia
had
no
currency
for
buying
import
goods
,
at
the
same
time
,
no-one
gave
credits
as
the
country
was
essentially
bankrupt.
the
collapse
of
the
soviet
social
system
led
to
serious
deterioration
in
living
standards.
millions
of
russians
were
thrown
into
poverty
due
to
their
savings
being
devalued
by
massive
hyperinflation.
moreover
,
the
privatization
and
break-up
of
state
assets
left
over
from
the
soviet
union
,
which
he
played
a
big
part
in
,
led
to
much
of
the
country
's
wealth
being
handed
to
a
small
group
of
powerful
business
executives
,
later
known
as
the
russian
oligarchs
,
for
much
less
than
what
they
were
worth.
the
voucher
privatization
program
enabled
these
few
oligarchs
to
become
billionaires
specifically
by
arbitraging
the
vast
difference
between
old
domestic
prices
for
russian
commodities
and
the
prices
prevailing
on
the
world
market.
because
they
stashed
billions
of
dollars
in
swiss
bank
accounts
rather
than
investing
in
the
russian
economy
,
these
oligarchs
were
dubbed
``
kleptocrats.
''
as
society
grew
to
despise
these
figures
and
resent
the
economic
and
social
turmoil
caused
by
the
reforms
,
gaidar
was
often
held
by
russians
as
one
of
the
men
most
responsible.
on
the
other
hand
,
the
ubiquitous
goods
deficit
of
the
soviet
years
disappeared
and
it
became
possible
to
buy
all
goods
in
the
shops.
per
capita
calorie
consumption
under
gaidar
diminished
by
<decimal>
%
from
<decimal>
kcal
to
<decimal>
kcal.according
to
franklin
foer
writing
in
the
atlantic
,
however
,
``
when
yegor
gaidar
...
asked
the
united
states
for
help
hunting
down
the
billions
that
the
kgb
had
carted
away
,
the
white
house
refused.
''
one
of
gaidar
's
most
outspoken
critics
was
the
yabloko
economist
and
mp
grigory
yavlinsky
,
who
had
proposed
since
<year>
a
<integer>
days
programme
for
the
transition
of
the
whole
ussr
to
market
economic
,
which
was
first
backed
and
then
dismissed
by
the
government
of
nikolai
ryzhkov.
yavlinsky
emphasized
the
differences
between
his
and
gaidar
's
reforms
program
,
such
as
the
sequencing
of
privatization
vs.
liberalization
of
prices
and
the
applicability
of
his
program
to
the
entire
soviet
union.
gaidar
's
supporters
contend
that
although
many
mistakes
were
made
,
he
had
few
choices
in
the
matter
and
ultimately
saved
the
country
both
from
bankruptcy
and
from
starvation.
according
to
the
bbc
's
andrei
ostalski
,
``
there
were
only
two
solutions—either
introduce
martial
law
and
severe
rationing
,
or
radically
liberalize
the
economy.
the
first
option
meant
going
all
the
way
back
to
the
stalinist
system
of
mass
repression.
the
second
meant
a
colossal
change
,
a
journey—or
,
rather
,
a
race—through
uncharted
waters
with
an
unpredictable
outcome.

gaidar
went
to
dublin
,
ireland
to
present
his
book
'death

'
at
an
academic

shortly
after

,
gaidar
felt
sick
and
returned
from

then
he
was
called
on

phone
to
come
down

deliver
his
speech
,
what
gaidar
has
later
recalled
as
a
call
that
saved
his
life

as
he
must
had
certainly
died

he
collapsed
in

recalled
that

''
.next

he
moved
from

arranged
a

to
moscow
where
the

familiar

a

gaidar
claimed
that
this
has
been
an
attempted

``

commented

)
was
a
swedish
geographer.
he
is
known
for
his
work
on
migration
,
cultural
diffusion
and
time
geography.
a
native
and
resident
of
sweden
,
hägerstrand
was
a
professor
(
later
professor
emeritus
)
of
geography
at
lund
university
,
where
he
received
his
doctorate
in
<year>.
his
doctoral
research
was
on
cultural
diffusion.
his
research
has
helped
to
make
sweden
,
and
particularly
lund
,
a
major
center
of
innovative
work
in
cultural
geography.
he
also
influenced
the
practice
of
spatial
planning
in
sweden
through
his
students.
==
early
life
==
hägerstrand
's
father
was
a
teacher
at
a
remote
elementary
school
and
the
family
lived
at
the
school.
hägerstrand
recalled
that
his
early
education
was
based
on
the
pedagogical
ideas
of
swiss
educator
johann
pestalozzi.
several
of
hägerstrand
's
students
speculated
that
his
holistic
and
visionary
thinking
was
rooted
in
his
early
education
:
he
was
taught
local
geography
,
history
and
folklore
at
home
in
the
pestalozzi
tradition
which
was
being
introduced
at
that
time.
cartography
,
geology
,
botany
and
agronomy
were
all
interrelated
parts
of
a
more
holistic
understanding
of
processes
within
a
spatial
area.
to
start
with
,
children
learned
about
their
immediate
environment
(
e.g.
,
the
school
room
and
the
farm
)
,
then
about
the
village
,
and
gradually
the
whole
district.
as
a
pupil
of
hägerstrand
,
it
is
easy
for
me
to
recognize
parts
of
this
tradition
which
later
became
what
we
today
would
refer
to
as
an
'integrative
perspective'.
==
academic
career
==
hägerstrand
entered
lund
university
in
<year>.
his
<year>
doctoral
thesis
innovation
diffusion
as
a
spatial
process
gained
fame
for
its
innovative
use
of
monte
carlo
simulation
of
demographic
development.
it
showed
how
dynamic
,
incremental
simulation
of
spatial
processes
could
be
used
at
the
spatial
scale
of
the
individual
as
well
as
large
spatial
aggregates.
forty
years
later
,
geographer
andrew
cliff
remarked
on
the
foresight
of
hägerstrand
's
methodology
:
``
bearing
in
mind
that
much
of
the
research
upon
which
the
book
is
based
dates
from
a
time
when
computers
were
almost
nonexistent
,
let
alone
used
by
geographers
,
it
is
remarkable
that
the
simulation
methodology
which
is
so
critically
dependent
upon
computing
power
should
have
been
contemplated.
''
hägerstrand
's
research
was
aided
by
developments
at
lund
university
,
notably
the
establishment
of
the
siffermaskinen
i
lund
(
smil
)
,
one
of
sweden
's
first
computers.
hägerstrand
noted
that
the
swedish
computer
scientist
carl-erik
fröberg
,
who
had
been
hägerstrand
's
``
school-mate
since
secondary
school
''
,
had
introduced
him
to
the
monte
carlo
method
that
would
define
his
doctoral
thesis
,
following
a
trip
by
fröberg
and
other
young
swedish
scientists
to
the
united
states
,
a
trip
that
was
financed
by
the
swedish
government
's
project
to
build
its
own
computer.in
<year>
,
he
presented
a
paper
titled
``
what
about
people
in
regional
science
?
''
to
the
european
congress
of
the
regional
science
association
in
copenhagen
,
denmark.
this
paper
,
published
in
<year>
,
developed
two
concepts
:
the
need
to
study
the
individual
in
order
to
understand
social
and
group
practices.
modern
cultural
geographers
commonly
now
study
everyday
practices
on
an
individualistic
basis
,
in
order
to
understand
larger
scale
patterns.
the
study
of
just
groups
creates
a
homogenization
of
reality
and
hides
the
truth.
a
link
between
space
and
time
that
had
previously
been
poorly
developed.
historically
,
social
scientists
had
treated
time
as
a
relevant
but
external
factor
to
spatial
features.
hägerstrand
's
early
work
on
innovation
diffusion
(
studying
the
geographical
spread
of
new
technologies
)
made
him
realise
that
the
two
,
though
separate
,
were
not
independent
of
each
other
;
they
have
what
french
theorist
henri
lefebvre
would
call
a
dialectical
relationship.
==
legacy
==
hägerstrand
's
initial
work
was
primarily
quantitative
,
which
is
important
as
the
discipline
of
geography
was
,
when
he
published
his
first
paper
in
<year>
,
a
highly
descriptive
subject.
in
the
<year>s
he
was
a
pioneer
of
geocoding
statistical
primary
data.
he
developed
models
and
statistical
techniques
,
such
as
the
time–space
cube
and
time–space
prism
,
which
later
became
important
in
the
development
of
geographic
information
systems
that
process
and
visualize
movement
data.
his
work
informed
the
likes
of
allan
pred
and
nigel
thrift
,
who
helped
take
it
to
the
english
speaking
world.hägerstrand
's
work
contributed
to
the
introduction
of
humanistic
thought
into
geography
,
which
led
to
the
development
of
critical
geography.
while
his
early
work
was
largely
quantitative
,
hägerstrand
's
later
work
paid
closer
attention
to
notions
of
embodiment
and
emotion.
still
,
his
methods
were
critiqued
by
feminist
geographer
gillian
rose
,
who
claimed
that
his
models
showed
a
masculine
and
falsely-ordered
view
of
the
world.
more
recent
geographers
have
tried
to
combine
time
geography
with
the
qualitative
research
and
affective
phenomenology
of
feminist
geography.
development
of
hägerstrand
's
work
has
continued
to
form
part
of
the
basis
for
non-representational
theory
,
and
a
reappraisal
of
his
work
by
new
generations
of
social
scientists
and
biologists
means
that
he
remains
an
influential
thinker
today.
in
<year>
,
nigel
thrift
summarized
five
benefits
of
hägerstrand
's
time
geography
for
contemporary
social
science
:
first
,
it
provides
a
sense
of
concreteness
,
of
the
power
of
'thereness
'
,
and
it
does
so
in
a
way—visually—that
is
still
the
preserve
of
too
few
social
theorists.
all
those
intricate
diagrams
were
,
in
part
,
an
attempt
to
describe
the
pragmatics
of
events
,
a
theme
which
has
now
,
in
the
work
of
writers
like
deleuze
,
become
fashionable
in
the
social
sciences
and
humanities
but
,
at
the
time
at
which
hägerstrand
was
working
,
tended
to
be
restricted
to
the
field
of
philosophy
,
except
for
the
work
of
social
interactionists
and
ethnomethodologists
which
was
often
very
imperfectly
understood
by
other
than
a
relatively
small
coterie
of
enthusiasts.
secondly
,
hägerstrand
's
work
was
an
attack
on
the
durkheimian
idea
that
space
and
time
were
social
categories
,
collective
representations
which
both
derived
from
society
and
also
dictated
to
society.
[
...
]
time-geography
makes
it
possible
to
go
beyond
social
constructionism
by
emphasizing
the
physical
constraints
on
human
action
and
the
wider
networks
of
competing
opportunities
that
they
set
up
which
act
to
steer
situations.
[
...
]
thirdly
,
and
as
a
directly
related
point
,
those
time-geographic
diagrams
did
something
else
too.
they
radically
lessened
the
distinction
between
humans
and
other
objects.
they
provided
a
kind
of
neutrality
of
representation
,
even
a
democracy
of
description
,
of
the
world.
[
...
]
fourthly
,
hägerstrand
's
work
espoused
a
geographical
ethics
,
centred
on
the
wise
use
of
space
and
time.
although
hägerstrand
would
often
use
economic
metaphors
to
describe
that
wisdom
in
the
use
of
space
and
time
,
i
am
sure
that
he
meant
something
broader
and
more
encompassing
which
it
seems
to
me
to
be
well
worth
keeping
hold
of
,
a
kind
of
democratic
ethos
of
the
cardinal
dimensions
,
a
conviviality
in
the
use
of
space
and
time.
fifthly
,
hägerstrand
provided
a
language
which
could
register
the
world
in
different
ways.
perhaps
one
way
of
looking
at
hägerstrand
's
work
is
as
a
means
of
saying
'hello
'
in
a
language
many
can
understand
:
drawing
as
a
kind
of
visual
esperanto.

suggested

andy
logan
wrote
a
thorough
account
of
this
position
in
her
against
the
evidence
(
<year>
)
,
as
she
became
convinced
of
his
innocence
in
the
murder
through
her
research.
they
suggest
that
becker
and
his
fellow
officers
had
stood
back
and
allowed
``
the
street
''
to
``
take
care
of
''
rosenthal
since
they
knew
that
his
co-operation
with
the
district
attorney
's
office
would
put
a
huge
target
on
his
back.
three
people
have
been
identified
as
having
a
major
stake
of
self-interest
in
becker
's
prosecution
for
murder.
allegedly
,
district
attorney
whitman
manipulated
the
evidence
to
implicate
the
corrupt
lieutenant.
becker
was
known
to
have
assets
that
far
exceeded
his
salary.
however
,
for
whitman
,
gaining
a
guilty
verdict
for
becker
in
the
sensational
murder
case
would
help
his
own
political
aspirations
,
and
he
is
thought
to
have
been
elected
as
governor
largely
based
on
his
success
in
that
goal.in
addition
,
the
reporter
herbert
bayard
swope
publicized
the
case
mercilessly
in
the
press
,
representing
the
power
of
the
new
york
world.
he
devoted
much
space
to
the
conduct
of
the
trial
and
individuals
'
testimony.
later
,
he
said
his
reporting
on
the
trial
catapulted
his
career.
lastly
,
as
noted
above
,
judge
john
goff
showed
his
bias
and
played
a
major
role
in
gaining
a
guilty
verdict
from
the
jury.new
york
police
historian
thomas
a.
reppetto
believes
that
becker
was
guilty
because
of
the
testimony
of
people
involved
but
also
he
had
a
strong
motive
and
had
shown
reckless
behavior.
the
consensus
continues
to
favor
becker
's
active
involvement
in

to
ralph

he
graduated
with

charles

earned
a
phd
in
chemistry
from
northwestern
university
in
<year>
under
malcolm
dole
,
a
polymer
chemist.
most
of
dole
's
graduates
were
going
straight
into
the
oil
industry
;
keeling
``
had
trouble
seeing
the
future
this
way
''
and
had
become
interested
in
geology
,
for
which
he
had
acquired
most
of
the
undergraduate
coursework
during
his
phd.
keeling
had
applied
for
postdoctoral
positions
as
a
chemist
almost
exclusively
to
geology
departments
``
west
of
the
continental

''
he
received
an
offer
from
harrison
brown
who
had
recently
started
a
geochemistry
department
at
california
institute
of

he
was
a

there
until

joined
scripps
institution

in
<year>
,
and
was
appointed

there
in

caltech
he
developed
the
first
instrument
able
to
measure
carbon

with
consistently
reliable
accuracy.
keeling
camped
at
big
sur
where
he
used
his
new
device
to
measure
the
level
of
carbon

and
found
that
it

==
work
with

<year>–<year>
==
keeling
worked
at
the
scripps
institution
for
<integer>
years
during
which
time
he
published
many
influential
papers.
roger
revelle
,
the
director
of
scripps
institution
of
oceanography
,
based
at
la
jolla
,
california
,
persuaded
keeling
to
continue
his
work
there.
revelle
was
also
one
of
the
founders
of
the
international
geophysical
year
(
igy
)
in
<year>–<integer>
and
keeling
received
igy
funding
to
establish
a
base
on
mauna
loa
in
hawaii
,
two
miles
(
<integer>
,
<integer>
m
)
above
sea
level.
keeling
started
collecting
carbon
dioxide
samples
at
the
base
in
<year>.
by
<year>
,
he
had
established
that
there
are
strong
seasonal
variations
in
carbon

levels
with
peak
levels
reached
in
the
late
northern
hemisphere
winter.
a
reduction
in
carbon

followed
during
spring
and
early
summer
each
year
as
plant
growth
increased
in
the
land-rich
northern
hemisphere.
in
<year>
,
keeling
produced
data
showing
that
carbon

levels
were
rising
steadily
in
what
later
became
known
as
the
``
keeling
curve
''
.
in
the
early
<year>s
,
the
national
science
foundation
stopped
supporting
his
research
,
calling
the
outcome
``
routine
''
.
despite
this
lack
of
interest
,
the
foundation
used
keeling
's
research
in
its
warning
in
<year>
of
rapidly
increasing
amounts
of
heat-trapping
gases.
a
<year>
report
from
president
johnson
's
science
advisory
committee
similarly
warned
of
the
dangers
of
extra
heat-trapping
gases
,
which
cause
the
temperature
of
the
earth
to
rise.
the
data
collection
started
by
keeling
and
continued
at
mauna
loa
is
the
longest
continuous
record
of
atmospheric
carbon
dioxide
in
the
world
and
is
considered
a
reliable
indicator
of
the
global
trend
in
the
mid-level
troposphere.
keeling
's
research
showed
that
the
atmospheric
concentration
of
carbon

grew
from
<integer>
parts
per
million
(

)
in
<year>
to
<integer>

in

,
with

sibley
developed
an
interest
in
hybridisation
and
its
implications
for
evolution
and
taxonomy
and
,
in
the
early
<year>s
he
began
to
focus
on
molecular
studies
:
of
blood
proteins
,
and
then
the
electrophoresis
of
egg-white
proteins.
by
the
early
<year>s
sibley
was
pioneering
dna-dna
hybridisation
studies
,
with
the
aim
of
discovering
,
once
and
for
all
,
the
true
relationships
between
the
modern
orders
of
birds.
these
were
highly
controversial
to
begin
with
,
and
regarded
by
colleagues
as
anything
from
snake-oil
salesmanship
on
the
one
hand
to
holy
writ
on
the
other.
with
the
passage
of
time
and
ever-improving
laboratory
methods
,
the
balance
of
scientific
opinion
has
shifted
closer
to
the
latter
interpretation
,
though
the
picture
is
by
no
means
clear-cut
and
simple.
some
of
sibley
's
results
–
such
as
the
close
relationship
of
galliform
birds
and
waterfowl
and
their
distinctness
from
other
neognaths
–
have
been
verified.
other
results
such
as
the
inclusion
of
diverse
groups
into
the
ciconiiformes
have
turned
out
to
be
very
much
in
error.
sibley
became
estranged
from
his
american
co-workers
for
a
time
and
corresponded
with
overseas
colleagues
extensively.
but
by
the
mid
to
late
<year>s
,
sibley
's
ongoing
work
had
reversed
the
trend.
his
revised
phylogeny
of
living
birds
in
the
light
of
dna
analysis
,
published
in
various
forms
in
<year>–<year>
was
both
controversial
and
highly
influential.
in
<year>
he
was
elected
a
member

u.s.a.
in
<year>
sibley
and
jon

were
awarded
the
daniel

elliot
medal
from

he
was
elected
president
of
the
international

his
landmark
publications
,
phylogeny
and
classification
of

(
written
with
ahlquist
)
and
distribution
and
taxonomy
of
birds
of

(

are

most-cited

during
the
<year>s
,
sibley
was
a
highly
controversial
figure
in
ornithological
circles
,
for
both
professional
and
personal
reasons.
his
friend
richard
schodde
,
writing
sibley
's
obituary
in

commented
that
he
was
:
...
a
rebel

in

he

,
brooking
no
contradiction.
critics
were
baited
with
an
acid
tongue
,
and
,
in
fits
of
temper
,
he
could
be
a
cruel
mimic.
in
short
,
lesser
mortals
were
not
tolerated
easily
and
,
as
has
been
said
by
others
,
collegiate
friends
were
few.

i
never
found
him
malicious

vindictive
,
even
against
those
who
had
tried
to
bring
him
down.
nor
was
he
particularly
sophisticated
or
cultured
,
just
a
big
,
up-front
yank
possessed
by
'the
big
picture
'
in
avian
phylogeny
and
convinced
of
the
righteousness
of
his
cause
and
invincibility
of
his
intellect.
partly
due
to
personality
conflicts
,
sibley
had
few
long-term
collaborations
with
other
scientists
,
with
the
notable
exception
of
jon
ahlquist.
nonetheless
,
he
was
effective
in
persuading
others
to
provide
him
with
the
blood

tissue
,
and
egg
white
samples
which
were
the
key
to

was
a

particularly
in
terms

the
concept

==
life
and
career
==
he
was
born
in
düsseldorf
,
germany.
ethnically
jewish
,
he
left
nazi
germany
because
of
rising
nazi
persecution.
he
initially
fled
to

with
his

and
then
to

attended

lenneberg
's
<year>
paper
``
the
capacity
of
language
acquisition
,
''
originally
published
in
<year>
,
sets
forth
seminal
arguments
about
the
human-specific
biological
capacity
for
language
,
which
were
then
being
developed
in
his
research
and
discussions
with
george
a.
miller
,
noam
chomsky
,
and
others
at
harvard
and
mit
,
and
popularized
by
steven
pinker
in
his
book
,
the
language
instinct.
he
presents
four
arguments
for
biological
innateness
of
psychological
capacities
,
parallel
to
arguments
in
biology
for
the
innateness
of
physical
traits
:
universal
appearance
of
a
trait
at
a
single
time
across
a
species.

rigidly
follows
a
given
schedule
regardless
of
the
particular
experience
of
the
organism.in
his
publication
biological
foundations
of
language
he
advanced
the
hypothesis
of
a
critical
period
for
language
development
;
a
topic
which
remains
controversial
and
the
subject
of
debate.
lenneberg
's
biological
approach
to
language
was
related
to
developments
such
as
the
motor
theory
of
speech
perception
developed
by
alvin
liberman
and
colleagues
at
haskins
laboratories
and
also
provided
historical
antecedents
to
issues
now
emerging
in
embodied
philosophy
and
embodied
cognition.
lenneberg
reargued
extensively
against
the
psychological
implications
of
the
work
of
edward
sapir
and
benjamin
lee
whorf
,
specifically
in
regards
to
the
idea
that
language
influences
thought.
lenneberg
's
argument
against
this
notion
was
that
'linguistic
and
non-linguistic
events
must
be
separately
observed
and
described
before
they
can
be
correlated.

leibenstein
(
<year>
–
february
<integer>
,
<year>
)
was
a
ukrainian-born
american
economist.
one
of
his
most
important
contributions
to
economics
was
the
concept
of
x-inefficiency
and
the
critical
minimum
effort
thesis
in
development
economics.
concerning
his
``
critical
minimum
effort
thesis
''
,
he
says
that
the
underdeveloped
countries
are
trapped
by
the
vicious
circle
of
poverty
and
many
other
growth
retarding
factors
which
keep
them
in
the
state
of
backwardness.
so
these
countries
need
to
increase
their
per
capita
income
to
a
certain
level
where
they
can
maintain
a
self-sustained
growth
rate
:
they
need
a
critical
minimum
effort
,
i.e.
,
they
need
to
invest
at
more
than
a
minimum
level
to
overcome
all
the
obstacles
of
the
underdeveloped
countries.
in
economics
,
x-efficiency
is
the
effectiveness
with
which
a
given
set
of
inputs
are
used
to
produce
outputs.
if
a
firm
is
producing
the
maximum
output
it
can
,
given
the
resources
it
employs
,
such
as
men
and
machinery
,
and
the
best
technology
available
,
it
is
said
to
be
technical-efficient.
x-inefficiency
occurs
when
technical-efficiency
is
not
achieved.
the
concept
of
x-efficiency
is
also
used
in
the
theory
of
bureaucracy.

the
son
of
adrienne
(
née
courville
)
(
<year>–<year>
)
and
aubert
bourassa
,
a
port
authority
worker.
robert
bourassa
graduated
from
the
université
de
montréal
law
school
in
<year>
and
was
admitted
to
the
barreau
du
québec
the
following
year.
on

<year>
,
he
married

and
also
obtained
a
degree
in
political
economy
at

as
a

quebec
legislator
==
bourassa
was
first
elected
as
a
member
of
the
legislative
assembly
of
quebec
(
mla
)
for
the
riding
of
mercier
in
<year>
,
then
won
the
quebec
liberal
party
leadership
election
on
january
<integer>
,
<year>.
he
positioned
himself
as
a
young
,
competent
administrator.
he
chose
``
<integer>
<integer>
jobs
''
as
his
slogan
,
which
emphasized
that
jobs
creation
would
be
his
priority.
bourassa
felt
the
extensive
hydro-electric
resources
of
quebec
were
the
most
effective
means
of
completing
the
modernization
of
quebec
and
sustaining
job
creation.
he
successfully
led
his
party
into
government
in
the
<year>
election
,
defeating
the
conservative
union
nationale
government
and
becoming
the
youngest
premier
in
quebec
history.
==
premier
of
quebec
(
<year>-<year>
)
==
one
of
bourassa
's
first
crises
as
premier
was
the
october
crisis
of
<year>
,
in
which
his
deputy
,
pierre
laporte
,
was
kidnapped
and
later
murdered
by
members
of
the
front
de
libération
du
quebec.
bourassa
requested
that
prime
minister
pierre
trudeau
invoke
the
war
measures
act
,
which
allowed
for
search
and
arrest
of
anyone
associated
with
,
or
thought
to
be
associated
with
the
flq.
he
further
requested
military
assistance
from
the
federal
government
,
which
resulted
in
the
deployment
of
troops
to
guard
vital
points
in
montreal
and
assist
police.
the
army
was
withdrawn
on
<day>
,
and
paul
rose
and
some
of
his
accomplices
were
found
guilty
of
murder
later
that
year.
bourassa
and
trudeau
often
clashed
over
issues
of
federal-provincial
relations
and
quebec
nationalism
,
with
trudeau
opposing
what
he
saw
as
concessions
to
sovereignism.
in
june
<year>
he
participated
in
an
attempt
at
constitutional
reform
,
the
victoria
charter
,
which
quickly
unravelled
when
bourassa
backed
away
from
the
proposed
deal
after
it
was
strongly
criticised
by
quebec
opinion
leaders
for
not
giving
quebec
more
powers.on
<day>
,
trudeau
announced
in
the
house
of
commons
that
,
after
much
deliberation
,
the
policy
of
multiculturalism
would
be
implemented
in
canada.
bourassa
documented
his
strong
opposition
to
trudeau
's
policy
in
a
letter
which
he
released
to
the
press
on
<day>
,
and
stated
he
had
``
serious
misgivings
about
the
principle
of
the
multicultural
policy
''
.
the
policy
document
tabled
in
the
house
``
dissociates
culture
from
language
''
,
which
seemed
to
bourassa
``
a
questionable
basis
on
which
to
found
a
policy
''
.
bourassa
declared
that
quebec
did
not
accept
the
federal
government
's
approach
to
the
principle
of
multiculturalism.during
his
time
in
power
,
bourassa
implemented
policies
aimed
at
protecting
the
status
of
the
french
language
in
quebec.
in
<year>
,
he
introduced
bill
<integer>
,
which
declared
french
to
be
the
sole
official
language
of
the
province.
as
a
result
,
quebec
was
no
longer
institutionally
bilingual
(
french
and
english
)
,
though
the
rights
of
anglophones
were
still
protected
under
the
british
north
america
acts.
many
businesses
and
professionals
were
unable
to
operate
under
such
requirements.
bill
<integer>
angered
anglophones
while
not
going
far
enough
for
many
francophones
;
bourassa
was
vilified
by
both
groups.
bourassa
initiated
the
james
bay
hydroelectric
project
in
<year>
that
led
to
the
james
bay
and
northern
quebec
agreement
of
<year>
with
the
cree
and
inuit
inhabitants
of
the
region.
the
bourassa
government
also
played
a
major
role
in
rescuing
the
<year>
olympic
games
in
montreal
from
huge
cost
overruns
and
construction
delays.
bourassa
's
government
became
embroiled
in
corruption
scandals.

rioted
using
their
bulldozers
to
destroy
the

they
were
working
on
while
other
workers
set
buildings
afire.
the
riot
caused
$

in

,
and
was
part
of
an
extortion
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
union
boss

``

''
desjardins
,
who
was
known
in

as
the
``

.
in
response
to
the
violence
at
the
lg<integer>
site
,
which
confirmed
long-standing
rumors
about
thuggish
practices
on
the
part
of
construction
unions
,
bourassa
appointed
a
commission
consisting
of
a
well
respected
judge
robert
cliche
,
a
prominent
montreal
labour
lawyer
brian
mulroney
and
guy
chevrette
,
the
vice-president
of
the
centrale
de
l'enseignement
du
québec
,
whose
legal
counsel
was
another
prominent
lawyer
lucien
bouchard
to
investigate
corruption
in
the
construction
industry
in
quebec.
the
cliche
commission
as
it
became
known
held
<integer>
days
of
hearings
on
live
tv
,
interviewing
<integer>
people
from
the
construction
industry
,
who
testified
to
widespread
corruption
and
violence
in
the
construction
industry
,
and
to
the
close
ties
between
the
bourassa
cabinet
,
the
mafia
and
corrupt
construction
union
bosses.
bouchard
had
wanted
to
have
bourassa
testify
before
the
commission
,
but
mulroney
prevented
this
,
saying
that
having
the
premier
of
quebec
testify
before
the
commission
would
be
a
violation
of
``
executive
privilege
''
.
nonetheless
,
the
cliche
commission
established
the
quebec
construction
industry
was
dominated
by
a
casual
brutality
with
thuggish
union
bosses
teaching
union
organizers
how
best
to
break
legs.
workers
who
complained
about
corruption
on
the
part
of
their
bosses
had
their
dogs
murdered
and
their
teenage
children
beaten
up.when
the
cliche
commission
presented
its
report
in
may
<year>
,
the
document
was
described
as
an
exposé
of
``
an
organized
system
of
corruption
without
parallel
in
north
america
''
as
the
commission
noted
that
it
was
political
corruption
that
had
enabled
the
corruption
in
the
construction
industry.
in
an
editorial
,
the
montreal
gazette
wrote
about
the
cliche
commission
report
:
``
a
devastating
document.
for
some
four
years
,
the
bourassa
government
worked
hand
in
glove
with
gangster
union
leadership
in
the
province
's
construction
industry.
''
the
cliche
commission
had
little
impact
on
the
problem
of
corruption
in
the
quebec
construction
industry
,
but
turned
public
opinion
against
bourassa
,
whose
special
adviser
had
asked
the
corrupt
construction
unions
to
help
the
liberals
win
a
by-election
in
exchange
for
giving
firms
that
employed
workers
in
the
corrupt
unions
exclusive
contracts
to
work
on

leader

on

after
the

liberal
mna
germain
leduc
resigned
in

during
his
second
term
as
premier
,
bourassa
invoked
the
notwithstanding
clause
of
the
canadian
charter
of
rights
and
freedoms
to
override
a
supreme
court
of
canada
ruling
that
declared
parts
of
the
charter
of
the
french
language
unconstitutional
,
causing
some
of
his
anglophone
ministers
to
resign.
a
few
years
later
,
however
,
he
introduced
modifications
to
the
language
charter.
these
compromises
reduced
the
controversy
over
language
that
had
been
a
dominant
feature
of
quebec
politics
over
the
previous
decades.
bourassa
also
pushed
for
quebec
to
be
acknowledged
in
the
canadian
constitution
as
a
``
distinct
society
''
,
promising
quebec
residents
that
their
grievances
could
be
resolved
within
canada
with
a
new
constitutional
deal.
he
worked
closely
with
prime
minister
brian
mulroney
and
received
many
concessions
from
the
federal
government
,
culminating
in
the
meech
lake
accord
in
<year>
and
the
charlottetown
accord
in
<year>.
the
meech
lake
accord
failed
in
june
<year>
when
two
provinces
,
manitoba
and
newfoundland
,
refused
to
ratify
the
agreement
their
premiers
had
signed.
that
failure
revived
the
quebec
separatist
movement.
the
charlottetown
accord
was
defeated
in
a
nationwide
plebiscite
in
<year>
;
it
was
heavily
defeated
even
in
quebec
,
partly
due
to
the
perception
that

had
given
away
too
much
at
the
negotiations.

the

substantial

for
imparting
a
holistic
approach
to
exploring

when
contemplating
where
to
conduct
his
advanced
graduate
work
,
he
rejected
both
the

,
as
he
did
not
feel
that
this
holism
was
embodied
in

departments.instead
,
he
chose
the
graduate
department
of
zoology
at

earned
his

academic
career
at

<year>
,
odum
took
a
job
as
an
instructor
of
biology
at
the
university
of
georgia
(
athens
,
georgia
)
.
in
the
late

,
while
serving
on
the
university
's
biology
faculty
committee
,
which
was
then
drawing
up
a
new
curriculum
,
he
concluded
there
was
an
urgent
need
to
incorporate
the
subject
of
ecology
,
since
he
learned
that
his
colleagues
generally
did
not
know
what
ecology
(
in
its
own
right
)
might
be.
he
founded
the
institute
of
ecology

later
named
for
him.
in

the
institute
of

,
which
odum
founded

the
odum
school
of

,
the
first
stand-alone
academic

dedicated
to

odum
also
founded
two

ecosystems
===
in
the
<year>s
and
<year>s
,
``
ecology
''
was
not
yet
a
field
of
study
that
had
been
defined
as
a
separate
discipline.
even
professional
biologists
seemed
to
odum
to
be
generally
under-educated
about
how
the
earth
's
ecological
systems
interact
with
one
another.
odum
brought
forward
the
importance
of
ecology
as
a
discipline
that
should
be
a
fundamental
dimension
of
the
training
of
a
biologist.
odum
adopted
and
developed
further
the
term
``
ecosystem
''
.
although
sometimes
said
to
have
been
coined
by
raymond
lindeman
in
<year>
,
the
term
``
ecosystem
''
first
appeared
in
a
<year>
publication
by
the
british
ecologist
,
arthur
tansley
,
and
had
in
<year>
been
coined
by
tansley
's
colleague
,
roy
clapham.
before
odum
,
the
ecology
of
specific
organisms
and
environments
had
been
studied
on
a
more
limited
scale
within
individual
sub-disciplines
of
biology.
many
scientists
doubted
that
it
could
be
studied
on
a
large
scale
,
or
as
a
discipline
in
itself.
odum
wrote
a
textbook
on
ecology
with
his
brother
,
howard
thomas
odum
,
a
graduate
student
at
yale.
the
odum
brothers
'
book
(
first
edition
,
<year>
)
,
fundamentals
of
ecology
,
was
the
only
textbook
in
the
field
for
about
ten
years.
among
other
things
,
the
odums
explored
how
one
natural
system
can
interact
with
another.
===
environmentalism
===
while
odum
did
wish
to
influence
the
knowledge
base
and
thinking
of
fellow
biologists
and
of
college
and
university
students
,
his
historical
role
was
not
as
a
promoter
of
public
environmentalism
as
we
now
know
it.
however
,
his
dedication
in
his
<year>
book
,
ecology
,
expressed
that
his
father
had
inspired
him
to
``
seek
more
harmonious
relationships
between
man
and
nature
''
.
by
<year>
,
when
the
first
earth
day
was
organized
,
odum
's
conception
of
the
living
earth
as
a
global
set
of
interlaced
ecosystems
became
one
of
the
key
insights
of
the
environmental
movement
that
has
since
spread
through
the
world.
he
was
,
however
,
an
independent
thinker
who
was
at
times
,
gently
critical
of
the
slogans
and
fashionable
concepts
of
the
environmentalist
movement.
===
legacy

odum
's

he
would

included

's
financial
contributions
were
focused
on
not

the
university

,
but
also
the
university
of
virginia
given
his
son
's
faculty
appointment
there
,
and
the

of

where
his

was
a

ultimately
,
his

the

,
along

==
career
==
===
the
vojta
method
===
vojta’s
research
was
focused
on
reflex
locomotion
therapy
,
particularly
in
the
treatment
of
children
exhibiting
developmental
delays.
he
discovered
the
basis
of
reflex
locomotion
while
searching
for
treatment
therapies
for
children
with
cerebral
palsy
and
spastic
paralysis.
he
discovered
that
muscle
groups
that
the
children
could
not
activate
themselves
can
be
activated
by
applying
pressure
to
specific
zones
on
a
patient’s
body.
repeated
activation
resulted
in
improved
gait
,
better
posture
and
improved
speech
in
children
with
cerebral
palsy.
professor
vojta
recognized
that
many
of
the
movement
complexes
he
found
could
be
traced
to
common
subjective
global
patterns
of
movement
that
mark
developmental
milestones
in
healthy
children.
although
the
emphasis
of
vojta’s
work
was
initially
directed
to
pediatrics
,
he
very
soon
recognized
that
the
treatment
could
also
be
applied
to
neurological
problems
in
adult
patients.
however
,
vojta
therapy
is
most
effective
in
patients
under
the
age
of
six
months
,
an
age
when
early
developmental
changes
are
most
profound.
vojta
therapists
use
a
combination
of
<integer>
different
zones
on
a
patient
's
body
,
applying
light
pressure
on
a
specific
area
and
resistance
to
the
current
movement
,
causing
the
patient
's
body
to
involuntarily
perform
certain
reflexive
movement
patterns.
repeated
stimulation
appears
to
make
previously
blocked
neurological
connections
between
the
patient
's
spinal
cord
and
brain.
the
patient
is
eventually
able
to
perform
similar
movements
without
any
external
stimulation.
vojta
therapy
has
been
used
to
treat
cerebral
palsy
,
peripheral
paralysis
of
the
arms
and
legs
,
hip
dysplasia
,
and
problems
in
breathing
,
swallowing
and
chewing.
in
recent
years
,
the
principles
underlying
vojta
's
method
have
been
adapted
to
dynamic
neuromuscular
stimulation
or
dns
,
a
modern
iteration
of
vojta
therapy.
dns
therapy
has
been
successfully
used
to
rehabilitate
athletic
injury
and
enhance
performance
,
leading
to
a
reduction
in
injury
,
decreased
recovery
time
,
and
increased
performance
markers.
when
an
adult
athlete
or
patient
is
injured
,
they
sometimes
revert
to
an
early
pattern
of
locomotion
similar
to
that
of
a
young
infant
,
before
proper
control
was
established.
for
example
,
a
patient
with
a
shoulder
impingement
may
internally
rotate
and
flex
their
arm
in
a
way
similar
to
a
two-month-old
child
who
has
not
yet
developed
external
rotation
and
extension.
in
this
case
,
dns
places
an
adult
patient
in
a
developmental
position
to
re-teach
proper
control
of
the
shoulder
joint.
while
vojta
therapy
has
been
recognized
for
decades
as
a
viable
treatment
method
throughout
europe
and
asia
,
it
has
only
recently
made
inroads
in
the
united
states
,
particularly
among
physical
therapists.
as
research
and
practice
of
the
vojta
method
grow
,
dr.
vojta’s
contributions
to
the
fields
of
physical
therapy
and
physical
performance
will
undoubtedly
gain
universal
recognition.

in
<year>
,
they
published
the
first

howard
wrote
the

they
continued
to
collaborate
in

for
howard
,
his
energy
systems

(
which
he
called
``

)
was
itself
a
collaborative
tool.
from
<year>
to
<year>
,
odum
worked
as
the
director
of
the
marine

of
the
university
of

during
this
time
,
he
became
aware
of
the
interplay
of
ecological-energetic
and
economic
forces.
he
taught
in
the
department
of
zoology
at
the

,
and
was
one
of
the

he
moved
to
the

where
he
taught
in
the
environmental
engineering
sciences
department
,
founded
and
directed
the

it
was
the
first

odum
continued
this

this
was
one

noted
that
odum
,
either
alone

:
an
overview
==
odum
left
a
large
legacy
in
many
fields
associated
with
ecology
,
systems
,
and
energetics.
he
studied
ecosystems
all
over
the
world
,
and
pioneered
the
study
of
several
areas
,
some
of
which
are
now
distinct
fields
of
research.
according
to
hall
(
<year>

,
odum
published
one
of

's
contributions
to
these
and
other
areas
are
summarized
below.
odum
also
wrote
on
radiation
ecology
,
systems
ecology
,
unified
science
,
and
the
microcosm.
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
discuss
the
use
of
ecosystems
for
life-support
function
in
space
travel.
some
have
suggested
that
odum
was
technocratic
in
orientation
,
while
others
believe
that
he
sided
with
those
calling
for
``
new
values
''
.
==
ecological
modeling
==
===
a
new
integrative
approach
in
ecology
===
in
his
<year>
ph.d.
thesis
,
odum
gave
a
novel
definition
of
ecology
as
the
study
of
large
entities
(
ecosystems
)
at
the
``
natural
level
of
integration
''
.
in
the
traditional
role
of
an
ecologist
,
one
of
odum
's
doctoral
aims
was
to
recognize
and
classify
large
cyclic
entities
(
ecosystems
)
.
however
,
another
one
of
his
aims
was
to
make
predictive
generalizations
about
ecosystems
,
such
as
the
whole
world
for
example.
for
odum
,
as
a
large
entity
,
the
world
constituted
a
revolving
cycle
with
high
stability.
it
was
the
presence
of
stability
,
which
odum
believed
enabled
him
to
talk
about
the
teleology
of
such
systems.
while
he
was
writing
his
thesis
,
odum
felt
that
the
principle
of
natural
selection
was
more
than
empirical
,
because
it
had
a
teleological
,
``
stability
over
time
''
component.
as
an
ecologist
interested
in
the
behavior
and
function
of
large
entities
over
time
,
odum
sought
to
give
a
more
general
statement
of
natural
selection
so
that
it
was
equally
applicable
to
large
entities
as
it
was
to
small
entities
traditionally
studied
in
biology.odum
also
wanted
to
extend
the
scope
and
generality
of
natural
selection
to
include
large
entities
such
as
the
world.
this
extension
relied
on
the
definition
of
an
entity
as
a
combination
of
properties
that
have
some
stability
with
time.
odum
's
approach
was
motivated
by
lotka
's
idea
's
on
the
energetics
of
evolution.
===
ecosystem
simulation
===
odum
used
an
analog
of
electrical
energy
networks
to
model
the
energy
flow
pathways
of
ecosystems.
his
analog
electrical
models
had
a
significant
role
in
the
development
of
his
approach
to
systems
and
have
been
recognized
as
one
of
the
earliest
instances
of
systems
ecology.electron
flow
in
the
electrical
network
represented
the
flow
of
material
(
e.g.
carbon
)
in
the
ecosystem
,
charge
in
a
capacitor
was
analogous
to
storage
of
a
material
,
and
the
model
was
scaled
to
the
ecosystem
of
interest
by
adjusting
the
size
of
electrical
component.
===
ecological
analog
of
ohm
's
law
===
in
the
<year>s
odum
introduced
his
electrical
circuit
diagrams
of
ecosystems
to
the
ecological
society
of
america.
he
claimed
that
energy
was
driven
through
ecological
systems
by
an
``
ecoforce
''
analogous
to
the
role
of
voltage
in
electrical
circuits.odum
developed
an
analogue
of
ohm
's
law
which
aimed
to
be
a
representation
of
energy
flows
through
ecosystems.
in
terms
of
steady
state
thermodynamics
,
ohm
's
law
can
be
considered
a
special
case
of
a
more
general
flux
law
,
where
the
flux
(
j
{
\displaystyle
j
}
)
``
is
proportional
to
the
driving
thermodynamic
force
(
x
{
\displaystyle
x
}
)
with
conductivity
(
c
{
\displaystyle
c
}
)
''
,
or
j
=
c
x
{
\displaystyle
j=cx
}
.kangas
states
that
odum
concluded
that
as
thermodynamic
systems
,
ecosystems
should
also
obey
the
force-flux
law
,
and
that
ohm
's
law
and
passive
electrical
analog
circuits
can
be
used
to
simulate
ecosystems.
in
this
simulation
,
odum
attempted
to
derive
an
ecological
analog
for
electrical
voltage.
voltage
,
or
driving
force
,
is
related
to
the
biomass
in
pounds
per
acre.
the
analogous
concept
required
is
the
biomass
activity
,
that
is
,
the
thermodynamic
thrust
,
which
may
be
linear.
exactly
what
this
is
in
nature
is
still
uncertain
,
as
it
is
a
new
concept.
such
a
consideration
led
odum
to
ask
two
important
methodological
questions
:
what
is
the
electrical
significance
of
a
function
observed
in
nature
?
given
an
electrical
unit
in
a
circuit
,
what
is
it
in
the
ecological
system
?
for
example
,
what
is
a
diode
in
nature
?
one
needs
a
diode
to
allow
biomass
to
accumulate
after
the
voltage
of
the
sun
has
gone
down
,
or
else
the
circuit
reverses.
higher
organisms
like
fish
are
diodes.
===
the
silver
springs
study
===
silver
springs
is
a
common
type
of
spring-fed
stream
in
florida
with
a
constant
temperature
and
chemical
composition.
the
study
odum
conducted
here
was
the
first
complete
analysis
of
a
natural
ecosystem.odum
started
with
an
overall
model
and
in
his
early
work
used
a
diagramming
methodology
very
similar
to
the
sankey
diagrams
used
in
chemical
process
engineering.starting
from
that
overall
model
,
odum
``
mapped
in
detail
all
the
flow
routes
to
and
from
the
stream.
he
measured
the
energy
input
of
sun
and
rain
,
and
of
all
organic
matter
-
even
those
of
the
bread
the
tourists
threw
to
the
ducks
and
fish
-
and
then
measured
the
energy
that
gradually
left
the
spring.
in
this
way
he
was
able
to
establish
the
stream
's
energy
budget.
''
===
ecological
and
biological
energetics
===
around
<year>
odum
directed
studies
into
radioecology
,
which
included
the
effects
of
radiation
on
the
tropical
rainforest
in
el
verde
,
puerto
rico
(
odum
and
pidgeon
)
,
and
the
coral
reefs
and
ocean
ecology
at
eniwetok
atoll.
the
odum
brothers
were
approached
by
the
atomic
energy
commission
to
undertake
a
detailed
study
of
the
atoll
after
nuclear
testing
;
the
atoll
was
sufficiently
radioactive
that
upon
their
arrival
the
odums
were
able
to
produce
an
autoradiographic
image
of
a
coral
head
by
placing
it
on
photographic
paper.
these
studies
were
early
applications
of
energy
concepts
to
ecological
systems
,
and
explored
the
implications
of
the
laws
of
thermodynamics
when
used
in
these
new
settings.from
this
view
,
biogeochemical
cycles
are
driven
by
radiant
energy.
odum
expressed
the
balance
between
energy
input
and
output
as
the
ratio
of
production
(
p
)
to
respiration
(
r
)
:
p-r.
he
classified
water
bodies
based
on
their
p-r
ratios
,
which
separated
autotrophic
from
heterotrophic
ecosystems
:
``
[
odum
's
]
measurements
of
flowing
water
metabolism
were
measurements
of
whole
systems.
odum
was
measuring
the
community
as
a
system
,
not
adding
up
the
metabolism
of
the
components
as
lindeman
and
many
others
had
done
''
.
this
reasoning
appears
to
have
followed
that
of
odum
's
doctoral
supervisor
,
g.
e.
hutchinson
,
who
thought
that
if
a
community
were
an
organism
then
it
must
have
a
form
of
metabolism.
however
,
golley
notes
that
odum
attempted
to
go
beyond
the
reporting
of
mere
ratios
,
a
move
which
resulted
in
the
first
serious
disagreement
in
systems
energetics.
===
maximum
power
theory
and
the
proposal
for
additional
laws
of
thermodynamics/energetics
===
in
a
controversial
move
,
odum
and
richard
pinkerton
(
at
the
time
physicist
at
the
university
of
florida
)
were
motivated
by
alfred
j.
lotka
's
articles
on
the
energetics
of
evolution
,
and
subsequently
proposed
the
theory
that
natural
systems
tend
to
operate
at
an
efficiency
that
produces
the
maximum
power
output
,
not
the
maximum
efficiency.
===
energy
systems
language
===
by
the
end
of
the
<year>s
,
odum
's
electronic
circuit
ecological
simulation
models
were
replaced
by
a
more
general
set
of
energy
symbols.
when
combined
to
form
systems
diagrams
,
these
symbols
were
considered
by
odum
and
others
to
be
the
language
of
the
macroscope
which
could
portray
generalized
patterns
of
energy
flow
:
``
describing
such
patterns
and
reducing
ecosystem
complexities
to
flows
of
energy
,
odum
believed
,
would
permit
discovery
of
general
ecosystem
principles.
''
some
have
attempted
to
link
it
with
the
universal
scientific
language
projects
which
have
appeared
throughout
the
history
of
natural
philosophy.
kitching
claimed
that
the
language
was
a
direct
result
of
working
with
analogue
computers
,
and
reflected
an
electrical
engineer
's
approach
to
the
problem
of
system
representation
:
``
because
of
its
electrical
analogy
,
the
odum
system
is
relatively
easy
to
turn
into
mathematical
equations
...
if
one
is
building
a
model
of
energy
flow
then
certainly
the
odum
system
should
be
given
serious
consideration
...
``
===
emergy
===
in
the
<year>s
in
the
latter
part
of
his
career
,
odum
and
david
m.
scienceman
developed
the
idea
of
emergy
as
a
specific
use
of
the
term
embodied
energy.
some
consider
the
concept
of
``
emergy
''
,
sometimes
briefly
defined
as
``
energy
memory
''
,
as
one
of
odum
's
more
significant
contributions
,
but
the
concept
is
neither
free
from
controversy
nor
without
its
critics.
odum
looked
at
natural
systems
as
being
formed
by
the
use
of
various
forms
of
energy
in
the
past
:
``
emergy
is
a
measure
of
energy
used
in
the
past
and
thus
is
different
from
a
measure
of
energy
now.
the
unit
of
emergy
(
past
available
energy
use
)
is
the
emjoule
,
as
distinguished
from
joules
used
for
available
energy
remaining
now.
''
this
was
conceived
as
a
principle
of
maximum
empower
,
which
might
explain
the
evolution
of
self-organising
open
systems.
however
,
the
principle
has
only
been
demonstrated
in
a
few
experiments
and
is
not
widely
recognized
in
the
scientific
community.
==
ecosystem
ecology
and
systems
ecology
==
for
j.
b.
hagen
,
the
maximum
power
principle
,
and
the
stability
principle
could
be
easily
translated
into
the
language
of
homeostasis
and
cybernetics
systems.
hagen
claims
that
the
feedback
loops
in
ecosystems
were
,
for
odum
,
analogous
to
the
kinds
of
feedback
loops
diagrammed
in
electronic
circuits
and
cybernetic
systems.
this
approach
represented
the
migration
of
cybernetic
ideas
into
ecology
and
led
to
the
formulation
of
systems
ecology.
in
odum
's
work
these
concepts
form
part
of
what
hagen
called
an
,
``
ambitious
and
idiosyncratic
attempt
to
create
a
universal
science
of
systems
''
.
===
macroscope
===
hagen
identified
the
systems
,
thinking
of
odum
as
a
form
of
holistic
thinking
,
who
contrasted
the
holistic
thinking
of
systems
science
with
reductionistic
microscopic
thinking
,
and
used

odum
was
a
pioneer
in
his
use
of
small
closed
and
open
ecosystems
in
classroom
teaching
,
which
were
often
constructed
from
fish
tanks
or

and
have
been
called
microcosms.

ecological
economics
==
ecological
economics
is
an
active
field
between
economics
and
ecology
with
annual
conferences
,
international
societies
,
and
an
international
journal.
from
<year>
to
<year>
,
odum
worked
as
director
of
the
marine
institute
of
the
university
of
texas.
during
this
time
odum
became
aware
of
the
interplay
of
ecological-energetic
and
economic
forces.
he
therefore
funded
the
research
into
the
use
of
conventional
economic
approaches
to
quantify
dollar
values
of
ecological
resources
for
recreational
,
treatment
and
other
uses.
this
research
calculated
the
potential
value
of
primary
production
per
bay
surface
area.for
hall
the
importance
of
odum
's
work
came
through
his
integration
of
systems
,
ecology
,
and
energy
with
economics
,
together
with
odum
's
view
that
economics
can
be
evaluated
on
objective
terms
such
as
energy
rather
than
on
a
subjective
,
willingness
to
pay
basis.
==
ecological
engineering
==
ecological
engineering
is
an
emerging
field
of
study
between
ecology
and
engineering
concerned
with
the
designing
,
monitoring
and
constructing
of
ecosystems.
the
term
ecological
engineering
was
first
coined
by
odum
in
<year>
,
before
he
worked
at
the
university
of
florida.
ecological
engineering
,
he
wrote
,
is
``
those
cases
where
the
energy
supplied
by
man
is
small
relative
to
the
natural
sources
but
sufficient
to
produce
large
effects
in
the
resulting
patterns
and
processes.
''
ecological
engineering
as
a
practical
field
was
developed
by
his
former
graduate
student
bill
mitsch
,
who
started
and
continues
to
edit
the
standard
journal
in
the
field
and
helped
to
start
both
international
and
u.s.
societies
devoted
to
ecological
engineering
,
and
has
written
two
textbooks
on
the
subject
one
of
odum
's
last
papers
was
his
assessment
of
ecological
engineering
that
was
published
in
the
journal
ecological
engineering
in
<year>
,
a
year
after
odum
died.
==
general
systems
theory
==
in
<year>
,
odum
was
elected
the
<integer>th
president
of
the
international
society
for
the
systems
sciences
,
formerly
named
the
international
society
for
general
systems
research.
he
presented
many
papers
on
the
general
systems
theory
at
its
annual
conferences
,
and
edited
the
last
published
general
systems
yearbook.
the
second
,
revised
edition
of
his
major
lifework
was
retitled
ecological
and
general
systems
:
an
introduction
to
systems
ecology
(
<year>
)
.
some
of
his
energy
models
and
simulations
contained
general
systems
components.
odum
has
been
described
as
a
``
technocratic
optimist
''
,
and
his
approach
was
significantly
influenced
by
his
father
,
who
was
also
an
advocate
of
viewing
the
social
world
through
the
various
lenses
of
physical
science.
within
the
processes
on
earth
,
odum
(
<year>
)
believed
humans
play
a
central
role
:
he
said
that
the
``
human
is
the
biosphere
's
programmatic
and
pragmatic
information
processor
for

''

war.
he
was
posted
briefly
to
australia
with
the
identity
of
a
lieutenant
colonel
in
case
he
was
captured.
he
was
to
go
through
england
,
egypt
,
china
and
then
on
to
india
and
ceylon.
he
then
worked
with
detachment
<integer>
in
bangkok
,
working
to
recover
allied
airmen
who
had
been
captured
in
the
region
with
the
help
of
friendly
thais
who
worked
to
keep
them
under
cover
from
the
japanese
forces.
after
this
period
he
moved
to
sri
lanka
and
never
got
to
australia
as
originally
planned.
he
worked
with
and
``
cultivated
''
lord
mountbatten
throughout
this
period.
the
two
often
met
at
dinners
and
parties
both
in
new
delhi
and
at
trincomalee.
on
one
occasion
,
ripley
noticed
a
green
woodpecker
and
went
off
to
shoot
it
while
dressed
only
in
a
towel.
the
specimen
label
reads
``

cocktail
party
...
towel
fell
off.
''
it
was
in
kandy
,
sri
lanka
that
he
met
his
future
wife
mary
livingston
and
her
roommate
julia
child
(
then
julia
mcwilliams
)
both
working
with
the
oss.
the
anthropologist
gregory
bateson
was
also
here
and
he
would
introduce
julia
to
paul
child
,
her
future
husband.
an
article
in
the
august
<integer>
,
<year>
new
yorker
said
that
ripley
reversed
the
usual
pattern
,
where
spies
posed
as
ornithologists
in
order
to
gain
access
to
sensitive
areas
,
and
instead
used
his
position
as
an
intelligence
officer
to
go
birding
in
restricted
areas.
the
government
of
thailand
awarded
him
the
order
of
the
white
elephant
,
a
national
award
for
his
support
of
the
thai
underground
during
the
war.
in
<year>
,
ripley
entered
nepal
pretending
to
be
a
close
confidante
of
jawaharlal
nehru
and
the
nepal
government
,
eager
to
maintain
diplomatic
ties
with
its
newly
independent
neighbour
,
allowed
him
and
edward
migdalski
to
collect
bird
specimens.
nehru
came
to
hear
of
this
from
an
article
in
the
new
yorker
and
was
furious
,
leading
to
a
difficult
time
for
his
collaborator
and
coauthor
,
salim
ali.
salim
ali
came
to
hear
of
nehru
's
displeasure
through
horace
alexander
and
the
matter
was
forgiven
after
some
effort.
the
oss
past
however
led
to
a
growing
suspicion
that
american
scientists
working
in
india
were
cia
agents.
david
challinor

unknown

usually
did.harsanyi
's
hungarian
degrees
were
not

they
earned
him
credit
at

while
in

harsanyi
's
student
visa
expired
in

returned
to
australia.
after
working
for
a
short
time
as
a
researcher
at
the
australian
national
university
in
canberra
,
harsanyi
became
frustrated
with
the
lack
of
interest
in
game
theory
in
australia.
with
the
help
of
kenneth
arrow
and
james
tobin
,
he
was
able

the

was
a

,
situations
in
which
the
various
strategic
decisionmakers
have
different

he
resolved
the
problem
of
how

could
make

while
not

knows
by
modelling
the
situation
with

moves
by

probabilities
to
choose
the
parameters
,
with
some
players
observing
nature

harsanyi
began
researching
utilitarian
ethics
in
the
mid-fifties
at
the
university
of
queensland
in
brisbane.
this
led
to
two
publications
explaining
why
,
before
understanding
moral
problems
,
the
difference
between
people
's
personal
and
moral
preferences
must
be
distinguished.
as
he
says
at

of
his
essay
included
in
the
book
edited
by

sen
and
b.

,
he
tries
to
reconcile
three
traditions
of

moral

those
of
adam
smith

immanuel
kant
and
the
utilitarians
(

in

after
leaving

walton
took
over
management
of
his
first
variety
store
at

age
of

with
the
help

a
$

plus
$

,
<integer>
he
had

army
,
walton
purchased
a
ben
franklin
variety
store
in
newport
,
arkansas.
the
store
was
a
franchise
of
the
butler
brothers
chain.
walton
pioneered
many
concepts
that
became
crucial
to
his
success.
according
to
walton
,
if
he
offered
prices
as
good
or
better
than
stores
in
cities
that
were
four
hours
away
by
car
,
people
would
shop
at
home.
walton
made
sure
the
shelves
were
consistently
stocked
with
a
wide
range
of
goods.
his
second
store
,
the
tiny
``
eagle
''
department
store
,
was
down
the
street
from
his
first
ben
franklin
and
next
door
to
its
main
competitor
in

with
the
sales
volume
growing
from
$

in

walton
drew
the
attention

p.
k.
holmes
,
whose
family
had
a
history
in
retail.
admiring
sam
's
great
success
,
and
desiring
to
reclaim
the
store
(
and
franchise
rights
)
for
his
son
,
he
refused
to
renew
the
lease.
the
lack
of
a
renewal
option
,
together
with
the
prohibitively
high
rent
of
<integer>
%
of
sales
,
were
early
business
lessons
to
walton.

walton
out

called

effectively
sold

negotiate
the
purchase

the

refused

walton
gave
up
on

paid

a

.sam
walton
is
regarded
as
one
of
the
greatest
project
entrepreneurs
in
the
retail
chain
industry.
he
had
a
great
passion
for
learning.
he
frequently
made
unannounced
visits
to
walmarts
around
the
country
to
learn
what
local
innovations
were
working
that
then
could
be
shared
with
other
walmarts.
on
one
of
those
visits
he
was
puzzled
by
a
greeter
saying
“hello”
at
the
entrance
of
the
store
and
asked
the
fellow
what
he
was
doing.
the
greeter
explained
that
his
main
job
was
to
discourage
shoplifters
from
taking
unpaid
merchandise
out
of
the
store
through
the
entrance.
walton
was
delighted
and
shared
the
innovation

called

store
,
it
was
located
at
<integer>
west
walnut
street.
he
launched
a
determined
effort
to
market
american-made
products.
included
in
the
effort
was
a
willingness
to
find
american
manufacturers
who
could
supply
merchandise
for
the
entire
walmart
chain
at
a
price
low
enough
to
meet
the
foreign
competition.as
the
meijer
store
chain
grew
,
it
caught
the
attention
of
walton.
he
came
to
acknowledge
that
his
one-stop-shopping
center
format
was
based
on
meijer
's
original
innovative
concept.
contrary
to
the
prevailing
practice
of
american
discount
store
chains
,
walton
located
stores
in
smaller
towns
,
not
larger
cities.
to
be
near
consumers
,
the
only
option
at
the
time
was
to
open
outlets
in
small
towns.
walton
's
model
offered
two
advantages.
first
,
existing
competition
was
limited
and
secondly
,
if
a
store
was
large
enough
to
control
business
in
a
town
and
its
surrounding
areas
,
other
merchants
would
be
discouraged
from
entering
the
market.to
make
his
model
work
,
he
emphasized
logistics
,
particularly
locating
stores
within
a
day
's
drive
of
walmart
's
regional
warehouses
,
and
distributed
through
its
own
trucking
service.
buying
in
volume
and
efficient
delivery
permitted
sale
of
discounted
name
brand
merchandise.
thus
,
sustained
growth—from
<year>
's
<integer>
stores
to
<year>
's
<integer>—was
achieved.given
its
scale
and
economic
influence
,
walmart
is
noted
to
significantly
impact
any
region
in
which
it
establishes
a
store.
these
impacts
,
both
positive
and
negative
,
have
been
dubbed

donald
hamilton
(

<day>
)
was
a
british
evolutionary
biologist
,
widely
recognised
as
one
of
the
most
significant
evolutionary
theorists
of
the
<integer>th
century.hamilton
became
famous
through
his
theoretical
work
expounding
a
rigorous
genetic
basis
for
the
existence
of
altruism
,
an
insight
that
was
a
key
part
of
the
development
of
the
gene-centered
view
of
evolution.
he
is
considered
one
of
the
forerunners
of
sociobiology.
hamilton
also
published
important
work
on
sex
ratios
and
the
evolution
of
sex.
from
<year>
to
his
death
in
<year>
,
he
was
a
royal
society
research
professor
at
oxford
university.
==
early
life
==
hamilton
was
born
in
<year>
in
cairo
,
egypt
,
the
second
of
seven
children.
his
parents
were
from
new
zealand
;
his
father
a.
m.
hamilton
was
an
engineer
,
and
his
mother
b.
m.
hamilton
was
a
medical
doctor.
the
hamilton
family
settled
in
kent.
during
the
second
world
war
,
the
young
hamilton
was
evacuated
to
edinburgh.
he
had
an
interest
in
natural
history
from
an
early
age
and
spent
his
spare
time
collecting
butterflies
and
other
insects.
in
<year>
,
he
discovered
e.
b.
ford
's
new
naturalist
book
butterflies
,
which
introduced
him
to
the
principles
of
evolution
by
natural
selection
,
genetics
,
and
population
genetics.
he
was
educated
at
tonbridge
school
,
where
he
was
in
smythe
house.
as
a
<integer>-year-old
,
he
was
seriously
injured
while
playing
with
explosives
his
father
had
that
were
left
over
from
making
hand
grenades
for
the
home
guard
during
world
war
ii.
hamilton
had
to
have
a
thoracotomy
and
fingers
on
his
right
hand
had
to
be
amputated
in
king
's
college
hospital
to
save
his
life.
he
was
left
with
scarring
and
needed
six
months
to
recover.
before
going
up
to
the
university
of
cambridge
,
he
travelled
in
france
and
completed
two
years
of
national
service.
as
an
undergraduate
at
st.
john
's
college
,
he
was
uninspired
by
the
``
many
biologists
[
who
]
hardly
seemed
to
believe
in
evolution
''
.
he
was
intrigued
by
ronald
fisher
's
book
the
genetical
theory
of
natural
selection
,
but
fisher
lacked
standing
at
cambridge
,
being
viewed
as
only
a
statistician.
hamilton
was
excited
by
fisher
's
chapters
on
eugenics.
in
earlier
chapters
,
fisher
provided
a
mathematical
basis
for
the
genetics
of
evolution
and
hamilton
later
blamed
fisher
's
book
for
his
getting
only
a
<integer>
:
<integer>
degree.
==
hamilton
's
rule
==
hamilton
enrolled
in
an
msc
course
in
demography
at
the
london
school
of
economics
(
lse
)
,
under
norman
carrier
,
who
helped
secure
various
grants
for
his
studies.
later
,
when
his
work
became
more
mathematical
and
genetical
,
he
had
his
supervision
transferred
to
john
hajnal
of
the
lse
and
cedric
smith
of
university
college
london
(
ucl
)
.
both
fisher
and
j.
b.
s.
haldane
had
seen
a
problem
in
how
organisms
could
increase
the
fitness
of
their
own
genes
by
aiding
their
close
relatives
,
but
not
recognised
its
significance
or
properly
formulated
it.
hamilton
worked
through
several
examples
,
and
eventually
realised
that
the
number
that
kept
falling
out
of
his
calculations
was
sewall
wright
's
coefficient
of
relationship.
this
became
hamilton
's
rule
:
in
each
behaviour-evoking
situation
,
the
individual
assesses
his
neighbour
's
fitness
against
his
own
according
to
the
coefficients
of
relationship
appropriate
to
the
situation.
algebraically
,
the
rule
posits
that
a
costly
action
should
be
performed
if
:
where
c
is
the
cost
in
fitness
to
the
actor
,
r
the
genetic
relatedness
between
the
actor
and
the
recipient
,
and
b
is
the
fitness
benefit
to
the
recipient.
fitness
costs
and
benefits
are
measured
in
fecundity.
r
is
a
number
between
<integer>
and
<integer>.
his
two
<year>
papers
entitled
the
genetical
evolution
of
social
behaviour
are
now
widely
referenced.the
proof
and
discussion
of
its
consequences
,
however
,
involved
detailed
mathematics
,
and
two
reviewers
passed
over
the
paper.
the
third
,
john
maynard
smith
,
did
not
completely
understand
it
either
,
but
recognised
its
significance.
having
his
work
passed
over
later
led
to
friction
between
hamilton
and
maynard
smith
,
as
hamilton
thought
smith
had
held
his
work
back
to
claim
credit
for
the
idea
(
during
the
review
period
maynard
smith
published
a
paper
that
referred
briefly
to
similar
ideas
)
.
the
hamilton
paper
was
printed
in
the
journal
of
theoretical
biology
and
,
when
first
published
,
was
largely
ignored.
recognition
of
its
significance
gradually
increased
to
the
point
that
it
is
now
routinely
cited
in
biology
books.
much
of
the
discussion
relates
to
the
evolution
of
eusociality
in
insects
of
the
order
hymenoptera
(
ants
,
bees
and
wasps
)
based
on
their
unusual
haplodiploid
sex-determination
system.
this
system
means
that
females
are
more
closely
related
to
their
sisters
than
to
their
own
(
potential
)
offspring.
thus
,
hamilton
reasoned
,
a
``
costly
action
''
would
be
better
spent
in
helping
to
raise
their
sisters
,
rather
than
reproducing
themselves.
==
spiteful
behaviour
==
in
his
<year>
paper
selfish
and
spiteful
behaviour
in
an
evolutionary
model
hamilton
considers
the
question
of
whether
harm
inflicted
upon
an
organism
must
inevitably
be
a
byproduct
of
adaptations
for
survival.
what
of
possible
cases
where
an
organism
is
deliberately
harming
others
without
apparent
benefit
to
the
self
?
such
behaviour
hamilton
calls
spiteful.
it
can
be
explained
as
the
increase
in
the
chance
of
an
organism
's
genetic
alleles
to
be
passed
to
the
next
generations
by
harming
those
that
are
less
closely
related
than
relationship
by
chance.
spite
,
however
,
is
unlikely
ever
to
be
elaborated
into
any
complex
forms
of
adaptation.
targets
of
aggression
are
likely
to
act
in
revenge
,
and
the
majority
of
pairs
of
individuals
(
assuming
a
panmictic
species
)
exhibit
a
roughly
average
level
of
genetic
relatedness
,
making
the
selection
of
targets
of
spite
problematic.
==
extraordinary
sex
ratios
==
between
<year>
and
<year>
hamilton
was
a
lecturer
at
imperial
college
london.
whilst
there
he
published
a
paper
in
science
on
``
extraordinary
sex
ratios
''
.
fisher
(
<year>
)
had
proposed
a
model
as
to
why
``
ordinary
''
sex
ratios
were
nearly
always
<integer>
:
<integer>
(
but
see
edwards
<year>
)
,
and
likewise
extraordinary
sex
ratios
,
particularly
in
wasps
,
needed
explanations.
hamilton
had
been
introduced
to
the
idea
and
formulated
its
solution
in
<year>
when
he
had
been
assigned
to
help
fisher
's
pupil
a.w.f.
edwards
test
the
fisherian
sex
ratio
hypothesis.
hamilton
combined
his
extensive
knowledge
of
natural
history
with
deep
insight
into
the
problem
,
opening
up
a
whole
new
area
of
research.
the
paper
was
also
notable
for
introducing
the
concept
of
the
``
unbeatable
strategy
''
,
which
john
maynard
smith
and
george
r.
price
were
to
develop
into
the
evolutionarily
stable
strategy
(
ess
)
,
a
concept
in
game
theory
not
limited
to
evolutionary
biology.
price
had
originally
come
to
hamilton
after
deriving
the
price
equation
,
and
thus
rederiving
hamilton
's
rule.
maynard
smith
later
peer
reviewed
one
of
price
's
papers
,
and
drew
inspiration
from
it.
the
paper
was
not
published
but
maynard
smith
offered
to
make
price
a
co-author
of
his
ess
paper
,
which
helped
to
improve
relations
between
the
men.
price
committed
suicide
in
<year>
,
and
hamilton
and
maynard
smith
were
among
the
few
present
at
the
funeral.hamilton
was
regarded
as
a
poor
lecturer.
this
shortcoming
would
not
affect
the
popularity
of
his
work
,
however
,
as
it
was
popularised
by
richard
dawkins
in
dawkins
'
<year>
book
the
selfish
gene.
in
<year>
he
married
christine
friess
and
they
were
to
have
three
daughters
,
helen
,
ruth
and
rowena.
<integer>
years
later
they
amicably
separated.
hamilton
was
a
visiting
professor
at
harvard
university
and
later
spent
nine
months
with
the
royal
society
's
and
the
royal
geographical
society
's
xavantina-cachimbo
expedition
as
a
visiting
professor
at
the
university
of
são
paulo.
from
<year>
hamilton
was
professor
of
evolutionary
biology
at
the
university
of
michigan.
simultaneously
,
he
was
elected
a
foreign
honorary
member
of
american
academy
of
arts
and
sciences.
his
arrival
sparked
protests
and
sit-ins
from
students
who
did
not
like
his
association
with
sociobiology.
there
he
worked
with
the
political
scientist
robert
axelrod
on
the
prisoner
's
dilemma
,
and
was
a
member
of
the
bach
group
with

members
arthur
burks
,
robert
axelrod
,
michael
cohen
,
and
john
holland.
==
chasing
the
red
queen
==
hamilton
was
an
early
proponent
of
the
red
queen
theory
of
the
evolution
of
sex
(
separate
from
the
other
theory
of
the
same
name
previously
proposed
by
leigh
van
valen
)
.
this
was
named
for
a
character
in
lewis
carroll
's
through
the
looking-glass
,
who
is
continuously
running
but
never
actually
travels
any
distance
:
``
well
,
in
our
country
,
''
said
alice
,
still
panting
a
little
,
``
you
'd
generally
get
to
somewhere
else—if
you
ran
very
fast
for
a
long
time
,
as
we
've
been
doing.
''
``
a
slow
sort
of
country
!
''
said
the
queen.
``
now
,
here
,
you
see
,
it
takes
all
the
running
you
can
do
,
to
keep
in
the
same
place.
if
you
want
to
get
somewhere
else
,
you
must
run
at
least
twice
as
fast
as
that
!
''
(
carroll
,
pp.
<integer>
)
this
theory
hypothesizes
that
sex
evolved
because
new
and
unfamiliar
combinations
of
genes
could
be
presented
to
parasites
,
preventing
the
parasite
from
preying
on
that
organism
:
species
with
sex
were
able
to
continuously
``
run
away
''
from
their
parasites.
likewise
,
parasites
were
able
to
evolve
mechanisms
to
get
around
the
organism
's
new
set
of
genes
,
thus
perpetuating
an
endless
race.

,
entitled
narrow
roads
of
gene
land
,
began
to
be
published
in
<year>.
the
first
volume
was
entitled
evolution
of
social
behaviour.
==
social
evolution
==
the
field
of
social
evolution
,
of
which
hamilton
's
rule
has
central
importance
,
is
broadly
defined
as
being
the
study
of
the
evolution
of
social
behaviours
,
i.e.
those
that
impact
on
the
fitness
of
individuals
other
than
the
actor.
social
behaviours
can
be
categorized
according
to
the
fitness
consequences
they
entail
for
the
actor
and
recipient.
a
behaviour
that
increases
the
direct
fitness
of
the
actor
is
mutually
beneficial
if
the
recipient
also
benefits
,
and
selfish
if
the
recipient
suffers
a
loss.
a
behaviour
that
reduces
the
fitness
of
the
actor
is
altruistic
if
the
recipient
benefits
,
and
spiteful
if
the
recipient
suffers
a
loss.
this
classification
was
first
proposed
by
hamilton
in
<year>.hamilton
also
proposed
the
coevolution
theory
of
autumn
leaf
color
as
an
example
of
evolutionary
signalling
theory.
==
expedition
to
the
congo
==
during
the
<year>s
,
hamilton
became
increasingly
interested
in
the
controversial
argument
that
the
origin
of
hiv
lay
in
oral
polio
vaccines
trials
conducted
by
hilary
koprowski
in
africa
during
the
<year>s.
a
letter
by
hamilton
on
the
topic
to
the
major
peer-reviewed
journal
science
was
rejected
in
<year>.
despite
this
rejection
,
he
gave
supportive
declarations
on
the
hypothesis
to
the
bbc
and
wrote
the
foreword
of
a
<year>
book
,
the
river
,
by
journalist
edward
hooper
,
who
investigated
the
hypothesis.
to
look
for
indirect
evidence
of
the
opv
hypothesis
by
assessing
natural
levels
of
simian
immunodeficiency
virus
,
in
primates
,
in
early
<year>
,
hamilton
and
two
others
ventured
on
a
field
trip
to
the
then-war-torn
democratic
republic
of
the
congo.
however
,
none
of
the
over
<integer>
urine
and
faecal
samples
collected
by
hamilton
contained
detectable
siv
virus.
==
death
==
he
returned
to
london
from
africa
on
<day>.
he
was
admitted
to
university
college
hospital
,
london
,
on
<day>.
he
was
transferred
to
middlesex
hospital
on
<day>
and
died
there
on
<day>.
an
inquest
was
held
on
<day>
at
westminster
coroner
's
court
to
inquire
into
rumours
about
the
cause
of
his
death.
the
coroner
concluded
that
his
death
was
due
to
``
multi-organ
failure
due
to
upper
gastrointestinal
haemorrhage
due
to
a
duodenal
diverticulum
and
arterial
bleed
through
a
mucosal
ulcer
''
.
following
reports
attributing
his
death
to
complications
arising
from
malaria
,
the
bbc
editorial
complaints
unit
's
investigation
established
that
he
had
contracted
malaria
during
his
final
african
expedition.
however
,
the
pathologist
had
suggested
the
possibility
that
the
ulceration
and
consequent
haemorrhage
had
resulted
from
a
pill
(
which
might
have
been
taken
because
of
malarial
symptoms
)
lodging
in
the
diverticulum
;
but
,
even
if
this
suggestion
were
correct
,
the
link
between
malaria
and
the
observed
causes
of
death
would
be
entirely
indirect.a
secular
memorial
service
(
he
was
an
agnostic
)
was
held
at
the
chapel
of
new
college
,
oxford
on
<day>
,
organised
by
richard
dawkins.
he
was
buried
near
wytham
woods.
he
,
however
,
had
written
an
essay
on
my
intended
burial
and
why
in
which
he
wrote
:
i
will
leave
a
sum
in
my
last
will
for
my
body
to
be
carried
to
brazil
and
to
these
forests.
it
will
be
laid
out
in
a
manner
secure
against
the
possums
and
the
vultures
just
as
we
make
our
chickens
secure
;
and
this
great
coprophanaeus
beetle
will
bury
me.
they
will
enter
,
will
bury
,
will
live
on
my
flesh
;
and
in
the
shape
of
their
children
and
mine
,
i
will
escape
death.
no
worm
for
me
nor
sordid
fly
,
i
will
buzz
in
the
dusk
like
a
huge
bumble
bee.
i
will
be
many
,
buzz
even
as
a
swarm
of
motorbikes
,
be
borne
,
body
by
flying
body
out
into
the
brazilian
wilderness
beneath
the
stars
,
lofted
under
those
beautiful
and
un-fused
elytra
which
we
will
all
hold
over
our
backs.
so
finally
i
too
will
shine
like
a
violet
ground
beetle
under
a
stone.

rémond
(
french
:
[

ʁemɔ̃
]
;
<day>
–
<day>
)
was
a
french
historian
,
political
scientist
and
political
economist.
born
in
lons-le-saunier
,
rémond
was
the
secretary
general
of
jeunesses
étudiantes
catholiques
(
jec
france
in
<year>
)
and
a
member
of
the
international
ycs
center
of
documentation
and
information
in
paris
(
presently
the
international
secretariat
of
international
young
catholic
students
)
.
the
author
of
books
on
french
political
,
intellectual
and
religious
history
,
he
was
elected
to
the
académie
française
in
<year>.
he
was
also
a
founding
member
of
the
pontifical
academy
of
social
sciences.
rémond
is
the
originator
of
the
famous
division
of
french
right-wing
parties
and
movement
into
three
different
currents
,
each
one
of
which
appeared
during
a
specific
phase
of
french
history
:
legitimism
(
counter-revolutionaries
)
,
orléanism
,
and
bonapartism.
boulangisme
,
for
example
,
was
according
to
him
a
type
of
bonapartism
,
as
was
gaullism.
these
he
considers
as
being
authoritarian
,
needing
a
leader
with
charisma
,
and
presenting
their
movements
as
more
``
populist
''
than
the
others.
legitimism
refers
to
the
royalists
who
refused
to
accept
the
french
republic
during
the
<integer>th
century.
(
the
action
française
royalist
movement
belongs
to
the
legitimists
,
who
,
being
marginalized
during
the
<integer>th
century
,
managed
however
to
take
back
some
influence
during
the
vichy
régime.
)
similarly
,
he
classes
the
national
front
(
le
pen
's
party
)
in
this
group.
orléanists
he
identifies
as
economic
liberals
,
which
characterizes
present-day
conservative
parties.
this
group
presents
itself
as
bourgeois
rather
than
populist.

liberal
government

quebec
premier
jean
lesage
during
the
quiet
revolution.

became
president
of
the
quebec
liberal
party
and
clashed
with
former

minister
and
colleague
rené
lévesque
in
<year>
,
daring
him
to
give
up
the
idea
of
quebec
separatism
or
quit
the

lévesque
later
quit
the
liberal
party
and
established
the
mouvement
souveraineté-association
,
which
became
quebec
's
leading
sovereigntist
party
as
the
parti
québécois.
initially
a
critic
of
walter
l.
gordon
's
economic
nationalism
,
kierans
'
experience
in
government
changed
his
mind
,
and
he
became
a
believer
in
the
need
for
state
intervention
in
the
economy.
in
<year>
,

trudeau.
he
did
not
run

partly
as
a

economic
policy.
kierans
called
for
canada

leave
the
north
atlantic
treaty
organization
(
nato

he
argued
that
the

might
have
served
a
useful
purpose
on
its
initial
formation
but
had
since
become
anachronistic.
some
others
with
the
trudeau
government
agreed
with
kierans
,
but
others
strongly
disagreed.
the
trudeau
government
ultimately
kept
canada
in
nato
but
reduced
canada
's
troop
deployment.
he
considered
running

this
included
work
in
the
nasa

programs
seeking
life
on
mars
and
the
chemistry

==
early
life
and
education
==
lederberg
was
born
in
montclair
,
new
jersey
,
to
a
jewish
family
,
son
of
esther
goldenbaum
schulman
lederberg
and
rabbi
zvi
hirsch
lederberg
,
in
<year>
,
and
moved
to
washington
heights
,
manhattan
as
an
infant.
he
had
two
younger
brothers.
lederberg
graduated
from
stuyvesant
high
school
in
new
york
city
at
the
age
of
<day>.
after
graduation
,
he
was
allowed
lab
space
as
part
of
the
american
institute
science
laboratory
,
a
forerunner
of
the
westinghouse
science
talent
search.
he
enrolled
in
columbia
university
in
<year>
,
majoring
in
zoology.
under
the
mentorship
of
francis
j.
ryan
,
he
conducted
biochemical
and
genetic
studies
on
the
bread
mold
neurospora
crassa.
intending
to
receive
his
md
and
fulfill
his
military
service
obligations
,
lederberg
worked
as
a
hospital
corpsman
during
<year>
in
the
clinical
pathology
laboratory
at
st.
albans
naval
hospital
,
where
he
examined
sailors
'
blood
and
stool
samples
for
malaria.
he
went
on
to
receive
his
undergraduate
degree
in
<year>.
==
bacterial

==
joshua
lederberg
began
medical
studies
at
columbia
's
college
of
physicians
and
surgeons
while
continuing
to
perform
experiments.
inspired
by
oswald
avery
's
discovery
of
the
importance
of
dna
,
lederberg
began
to
investigate
his
hypothesis
that
,
contrary
to
prevailing
opinion
,
bacteria
did
not
simply
pass
down
exact
copies
of
genetic
information
,
making
all
cells
in
a
lineage
essentially
clones.
after
making
little
progress
at
columbia
,
lederberg
wrote
to
edward
tatum
,
ryan
's
post-doctoral
mentor
,
proposing
a
collaboration.
in
<year>
and
<year>
,
lederberg
took
a
leave
of
absence
to
study
under
the
mentorship
of
tatum
at
yale
university.
lederberg
and
tatum
showed
that
the
bacterium
escherichia
coli
entered
a
sexual
phase
during
which
it
could
share
genetic
information
through
bacterial
conjugation.
with
this
discovery
and
some
mapping
of
the
e.
coli
chromosome
,
lederberg
was
able
to
receive
his
ph.d.
from
yale
university
in
<year>.
joshua
married
esther
miriam
zimmer
(
herself
a
student
of
edward
tatum
)
on
december
<integer>
,
<year>.
instead
of
returning
to
columbia
to
finish
his
medical
degree
,
lederberg
chose
to
accept
an
offer
of
an
assistant
professorship
in
genetics
at
the
university
of
wisconsin–madison.
his
wife
esther
lederberg
went
with
him
to
wisconsin.
she
received
her
doctorate
there
in
<year>.
joshua
lederberg
and
norton
zinder
showed
in
<year>
that
genetic
material
could
be
transferred
from
one
strain
of
the
bacterium
salmonella
typhimurium
to
another
using
viral
material
as
an
intermediary
step.
this
process
is
called
transduction.
in
<year>
,
m.
laurance
morse
,
esther
lederberg
and
joshua
lederberg
also
discovered
specialized
transduction.
the
research
in
specialized
transduction
focused
upon
lambda
phage
infection
of
e.
coli.
transduction
and
specialized
transduction
explained
how
bacteria
of
different
species
could
gain
resistance
to
the
same
antibiotic
very
quickly.
during
her
time
in
joshua
lederberg
's
laboratory
,
esther
lederberg
also
discovered

was
a
soviet
mathematician
and
computer
scientist
,
best
known
for
the
gauss–kronrod
quadrature
formula
which
he
published
in
<year>.
earlier
,
he
worked
on
computational
solutions
of
problems
emerging
in
theoretical
physics.
he
is
also
known
for
his
contributions
to
economics
,
specifically
for
proposing
corrections
and
calculating
price
formation
for
the
ussr.
later
,
kronrod
gave
his
fortune
and
life
to
medicine
to
care
for
terminal
cancer
patients.
kronrod
is
remembered
for
his
captivating
personality
and
was
admired
as
a
student
,
teacher
and
leader.
he
is
the
author
of
several
well
known
books
,
including
``
nodes
and
weights
of
quadrature
formulas.
sixteen-place
tables
''
and
``

''
.
a
biographer
wrote
kronrod
gave
ideas
``

,
quite
honestly
being
convinced
that
the
authorship
belongs

''
==
education
==
kronrod
was
born
in
moscow.
growing
up
,
he
studied
math
with
d.
o.
shklyarsky
in
school
and
in
<year>
entered
the
department
of
mechanics
and
mathematics
at
moscow
state
university.
he
did
his
first
independent
mathematical
work
as
a
freshman
with
professor
a.
o.
gel'fond.
kronrod
was
honored
as
a
student
with
the
first
prize
of
the
moscow
mathematical
society
and
was
the
only
person
to
win
the
prize
twice.
during
world
war
ii
he
was
rejected
for
military
service
because
at
the
time
graduate
level
students
were
exempt.
they
did
help
to
build
trenches
around
moscow
,
and
when
he
returned
,
kronrod
reapplied
and
was
accepted.
he
served
twice
,
and
was
injured
twice.
he
was
awarded
several
medals
,
including
order
of
the
red
star
and
order
of
the
patriotic
war.
the
second
injury
in
<year>
hospitalised
him
for
a
year
and
he
was
discharged
from
the
army
in
<year>.
this
injury
made
him
an
invalid
of
sorts
for
life.
kronrod
was
married
and
about
this
time
his
son
was
born.
during
next
four
years
he
continued
his
studies
at
the
university
,
simultaneously
working
at
the
atomic
energy
kurchatov
institute.
there
he
chose
to
leave
pure
mathematics
and
pursue
computational
mathematics.
in
his
last
undergraduate
year
,
kronrod
studied
with
nikolai
luzin
the
teacher
of
many
of
the
soviet
union
's
finest
scientists.
kronrod
and
georgy
adelson-velsky
were
colleagues
and
luzin
's
last
students.
like
his
teacher
,
kronrod
led
a
series
of
supplementary
seminars
for
younger
mathematics
students.
unusually
for
the
time
,
instead
of
students
merely
reporting
on
the
content
of
courses
,
kronrod
made
his
students
undertake
training
exercises
,
even
proving
basic
theorems
themselves.
the
preparation
required
for
this
reduced
the
numbers
of
participants
,
but
those
who
remained
,
including
r.
a.
minlos
and
a.
g.
vitushkin
,
derived
great
benefit.
vitushkin
described
him
as
``
witty
and
friendly
''
.
at
his
own
request
,
kronrod
was
called
simply
``
sasha
''
by
his
students.
he
was
considered
to
be
a
prophet
in
his
field.
the
kronod
circle
met
between
<year>
and
<year>.
kronrod
's
position
was
formally
at
the
institute
of
physics
,
which
meant
that
his
students
had
to
register
with
other
advisers
,
accounting
for
the
decline
of
the
circle
into
a
series
of
friendly
meetings.
when
he
defended
thesis
in
<year>
,
his
committee
including
m.
v.
keldish
,
a.
n.
kolmogorov
and
d.
e.
men'shov
bypassed
the
candidate
of
sciences
degree
and
awarded
him
a
doctor
of
sciences
degree
in
the
physical-mathematical
sciences.
kronrod
taught
at
the
moscow
pedagogical
institute.
yevgeniy
landis
was
a
student
,
early
collaborator
and
one
of
his
biographers.
during
the
<year>s
he
worked
on
mathematics
education
in
high
schools
by
organizing
courses
and
teaching
methods.
==
computer
science
==
kronod
played
an
important
role
in
building
the
first
major
russian
computer
,
relay
computer
rvm<integer>
,
though
he
liked
to
say
his
colleague
n.i.
bessonov
was
the
sole
inventor.
at
the
moscow
institute
for
theoretical
and
experimental
physics
(
itef
or
itep
)
during
<year>–<year>
kronod
collaborated
with
physicists
,
among
them
isaak
pomeranchuk
and
lev
landau.
for
providing
theoretical
physics
with
numerical
solutions
he
received
the
stalin
prize
and
an
order
of
the
red
banner.
in
<year>
,
he
first
used
an
electronic
computer
at
the
krzhizhanovskii
laboratory
of
the
institute
of
energy
of
the
russian
academy
of
sciences
,
later
called
the
institute
for
electronic
control
machines.
he
directed
the
mathematics
division
of
itep.
they
could
surpass
the
results
achieved
outside
the
ussr
by
far
faster
machines
,
in
the
case
of
cern
in
geneva
,
five
hundred
times
faster.
requests
for
computation
were
analyzed
and
sometimes
solved
by
other
means.
the
equipment
was
maintained
and
there
were
almost
no
hardware
malfunctions.
a
policy
said
finished
programs
had
to
be
re-examined
if
they
ran
for
more
than
ten
minutes.
kronrod
rewarded
accuracy.
he
held
what
today
are
controversial
views
on
the
role
of
gender
in
computing.
he
employed
women
in
itep
's
coding
and
card
punching
groups
,
believing
that
female
computing
staff
members
are
more
accurate
than
males.
he
also
believed
that
in
order
to
think
,
the
male
scientists
qualified
to
use
the
computers
needed
to
be
free
from
operating
them.
the
women
did
the
input
and
quality
assurance
side
by
side
with
the
men
and
for
each
month
without
an
error
received
a
<integer>
%
raise
in
salary.
he
applied
computing
resources
to
the
ussr
planned
economy
and
to
cancer
research.
he
served
with
leonid
kantorovich
and
others
on
a
cabinet
ministry
commission
and
oversaw
the
computation
of
the
country
's
material
expenditures
to
correct
price
formation.
kronrod
's
student
v.
d.
belkin
further
developed
this
work.
at
the
gertsen
cancer
research
institute
during
the
<year>s
,
with
his
student
p.
e.
kunin
he
studied
the
differential
diagnostics
of
lung
cancer
and
pneumonia
to
help
doctors
determine
when
surgery
is
needed.
==
artificial
intelligence
==
kronrod
had
a
profound
interest
in
artificial
intelligence
known
in
the
ussr
at
the
time
as
heuristic
programming.
he
is
well
known
for
saying
,
``
chess
is
the
drosophila
of
artificial
intelligence.
''
this
quote
graces
the
top
of
the
american
association
for
artificial
intelligence
``

''
chess
home

<year>
,
itep
challenged
and
in
<year>–<year>
defeated
the
american
chess
program
kotok-mccarthy.
the
developers
included
adelson-velsky
who
used
a.l.
brudno
's
adversarial
search
algorithm
and
a
``
general
recursive
search
scheme
''
by
kronrod.
they
were
advised
by
russian
chess
master
a.r.
bitman
and
world
champion
mikhail
botvinnik
in
what
was
the
first
test
of
shannon
brute
force
vs.
selective
search.kronrod
's
participation
came
at
great
cost.
the
physics
users
at
itep
complained
,
thinking
that
the
lab
was
being
used
for
game
playing
,
when
the
division
was
writing
the
crazy
eights
card
game
and
chess
trying
to
teach
a
machine
to
think.
==
end
of
a
career
==
when
the
communist
party
reprimanded
him
in
<year>
for
cosigning
a
letter
with
many
mathematicians
in
defense
of
the
mathematician
and
logician
alexander
esenin-volpin
,
a
son
of
the
poet
sergei
esenin
,
the
physicists
were
able
to
oust
him
from
itep.
he
was
also
fired
from
his
professorship.he
then
directed
the
mathematics
laboratory
at
the
central
scientific
research
institute
of
patent
information
(
cniipi
)
where
he
proposed
patent
reform
to
stimulate
inventions.
after
gaining
support
he
lost
this
position
to
an
unsympathetic
director.
his
last
position
was
heading
a
central
geophysical
expedition
laboratory
that
processed
drilling
data
where
he
made
calculations
for
gas
and
oil
exploration
,
but
he
was
not
challenged
by
this
work.
he
re-examined
his
goals
and
soon
changed
course.
==
medicine
==
kronrod
decided
that
his
best
work
was
to
help
others
and
most
importantly
the
terminally
ill.
he
spent
his
fortune
developing
milil
from
a
sour
milk
extract
for
cancer
patients
,
to
fill
a
shortage
of
anabol
,
an
expensive
drug
developed
in
small
quantities
by
his
acquaintance
bogdanov
in
bulgaria.
he
was
promised
but
never
acquired
an
animal
testing
laboratory
so
he
tested
the
medicine
on
himself.
kronrod
had
no
medical
degree
but
he
was
well-informed
in
medicine.
milil
was
a
last
resort
for
seriously
ill
patients
and
was
administered
by
physicians
in
one
case
in
a
hospital
ward
a.a.
vishnevskiy
reserved
for
treatments
by
kronrod
's
method.
kronrod
himself
never
gave
the
drug
to
patients
and
through
physicians
gave
it
away
free.
the
drug
was
unapproved
and
a
criminal
case
was
brought
against
him.
he
regained
his
research
records
when
a
relative
of
the
plaintiff
required
milil
for
treatment
and
the
case
was
dismissed.
he
slowly
recovered
when
a
stroke
took
his
speech
and
ability
to
read
and
write
but
was
forced
to
resign
at
the
central
geophysical
expedition
and
stop
all
work
on
math.
he
saved
his
own
life
by
asking
to
be
soaked
in
a
tub
of
very
hot
water
for
several
hours
after
a
second
stroke.
he
died
on
<day>
of
a
third
stroke.

was
a
spanish
primatologist
and
worldwide
specialist
in
ethology
,
the
study
of
animal
behavior.
sabater
was
known
for
describing
the
cultural
behaviors
of
several
species
,
including
the
use
of
tools
by
chimpanzees.
during
the
<year>s
,
he
purchased
snowflake
,
a
very
rare
albino
gorilla
,
and
transported
him
to
barcelona
zoo
,
where
he
lived
until
his
death
in
<year>.
sabater
pi
was
born
in
barcelona
,
spain.
he
was
professor
of
ethology
at
the
faculty
of
psychology
at
the
university
of
barcelona
and
pioneered
the
study
of
animal
behaviour
and
primatology
in
spain.
his
line
of
work
has
been
continued
inside

outside
the
university

by
several
of

disciples
,
such
as
joaquim
j.
veà
baró
,
matthew
escobar
aliaga
,
and
montserrat
colell
mimó.
as
a
sign
of
his
commitment
to
chimpanzees
,
and
prompted
by
the
finding
of
their
proximity
(
both
genetically
and
behavioural
)
with
humans
,
and
the
threats
hanging
over
their
habitats
,
sabater
pi
once
said
that
the
decline
in
population
and
,
in
the
case
of
some
subspecies
,
their
near
extinction
,
was
comparable
to
genocide
among
human
beings.
since
the
initial
years
of
the
<integer>st

,
sabater
pi
has
took
sides
in

jimmie
savage
(
born
leonard
ogashevitz
;
<day>
–
<day>
)
was
an
american
mathematician
and
statistician.
economist
milton
friedman
said
savage
was
``
one
of
the
few
people
i
have
met
whom
i
would
unhesitatingly
call
a
genius.
''
he
graduated
from
the
university
of
michigan
and
later
worked
at
the
institute
for
advanced
study
in
princeton
,
new
jersey
,
the
university
of
chicago
,
the
university
of
michigan
,
yale
university
,
and
the
statistical
research
group
at
columbia
university.
though
his
thesis
advisor
was
sumner
myers
,
he
also
credited
milton
friedman
and
w.
allen
wallis
as
statistical
mentors.
his
most
noted
work
was
the
<year>
book
the
foundations
of
statistics
,
in
which
he
put
forward
a
theory
of
subjective
and
personal
probability
and
statistics
which
forms
one
of
the
strands
underlying
bayesian
statistics
and
has
applications
to
game
theory.
during
world
war
ii
,
savage
served
as
chief
``
statistical
''
assistant
to
john
von
neumann
,
the
mathematician
credited
with
describing
the
principles
upon
which
electronic
computers
should
be
based.
later
he
was
one
of
the
participants
in
the
macy
conferences
on
cybernetics.one
of
savage
's
indirect
contributions
was
his
discovery
of
the
work
of
louis
bachelier
on
stochastic
models
for
asset
prices
and
the
mathematical
theory
of
option
pricing.
savage
brought
the
work
of
bachelier
to
the
attention
of
paul
samuelson.
it
was
from
samuelson
's
subsequent
writing
that
``
random
walk
''
(
and
subsequently
brownian
motion
)
became
fundamental
to
mathematical
finance.
in
<year>
he
introduced
the
minimax
regret
criterion
used
in
decision
theory.
the
hewitt–savage
zero–one
law
and
friedman–savage
utility
function
are
(
in
part
)
named
after
him
,
as
is
the
savage
award
given
annually
by
the
international
society
for
bayesian
analysis
for
the
best
dissertations
in
bayesian
analysis.

chandler
's
masterwork
was
the
visible
hand
:
the
managerial
revolution
in
american
business
(
<year>
)
.
his
first
two
chapters
looked
at
traditional
owner-operated
small
business
operations
in
commerce
and
production
,
including
the
largest
among
them
,
the
slave
plantations
in
the
south.
chapters
<integer><integer>
summarize
the
history
of
railroad
management
,
with
stress
on
innovations
not
just
in
technology
but
also
in
accounting
,
finance
and
statistics.
he
then
turned
to
the
new
business
operations
made
possible
by
the
rail
system
in
mass
distribution
,
such
as
jobbers
,
department
stores
and
mail
order.

)
review
mass
innovation
in
mass
production.
the
integration
of
mass
distribution
and
mass
production
(
ch
<integer><integer>
)
led
to
many
mergers
and
the
emergence
of
giant
industrial
corporations
by
<year>.
management
for
chandler
was
much
more
than
the
ceo
,
it
was
the
whole
system
of
techniques
and
included
middle
management
(
ch
<integer>
)
as
well
as
the
corporate
structure
of
the
biggest
firms
,
standard
oil
,
general
electric
,
us
steel
,
and
dupont
(
ch
<integer><integer>
)
.
chandler
argued
that
managerial
firms
evolved
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
productive
techniques
available
after
the
rail
network
was
in
place.
these
firms
had
a
higher
productivity
and
lower
costs
resulting
in
higher
profits.
the
firms
created
the
``
managerial
class
''
in
america
because
they
needed
to
coordinate
the
increasingly
complex
and
interdependent
system.
according
to
steven
usselman
,
this
ability
to
achieve
efficiency
through
coordination
,
and
not
some
anti-competitive
monopolistic
greed
by
robber
barons
,
explained
the
high
levels
of
concentration
in
modern
american
industry.
==
organizational
synthesis
==
along
with
economist
oliver
e.
williamson
and
historians
louis
galambos
,
robert
h.
wiebe
,
and
thomas
c.
cochran
,
chandler
was
a
leading
historian
of
the
notion
of
organizational
synthesis.he
argued
that
during
the
<integer>th
century
,
the
development
of
new
systems
based
on
steam
power
and
electricity
created
a
second
industrial
revolution
,
which
resulted
in
much
more
capital-intensive
industries
than
had
the
industrial
revolution
of
the
previous
century.
the
mobilization
of
the
capital
necessary
to
exploit
these
new
systems
required
a
larger
number
of
workers
and
managers
,
and
larger
physical
plants
than
ever
before.
more
particularly
,
the
thesis
of
the
visible
hand
is
that
,
counter
to
other
theses
regarding
how
capitalism
functions
,
administrative
structure
and
managerial
coordination
replaced
adam
smith
's
``
invisible
hand
''
(
market
forces
)
as
the
core
developmental
and
structuring
impetus
of
modern
business.
in
the
wake
of
this
increase
of
industrial
scale
,
three
successful
models
of
capitalism
emerged
,
which
chandler
associated
with
the
three
leading
countries
of
the
period
:
great
britain
(
``
personal
capitalism
''
)
,
the
united
states
(
``
competitive
capitalism
''
)
and
germany
(
``
cooperative
capitalism.
''
)
despite
the
important
differences
in
these
three
models
,
the
common
thread
among
the
developed
nations
is
that
the
large
industrial
firm
has
been
the
engine
of
growth
in
three
ways
:
first
,
it
has
provided
focal
points
for
capital
and
labor
on
large
scales
;
second
,
it
became
the
educator
whereby
a
nation
learned
the
pertinent
technology
and
developed
managerial
skills
;
third
,
it
served
as
the
core
around
which
medium
and
small
firms
that
supply
and
serve
it
grew.
==
influence
==
chandler
's
work
was
somewhat
ignored
in
history
departments
,
but
proved
influential
in
business
,
economics
,
and
sociology.in
the
business
field
,
chandler
,
along
with
kenneth
r.
andrews
and
igor
ansoff
,
has
been
credited
with
the
foundational
role
in
introducing
and
popularizing
the
concept
of
business
strategy.in
sociology
,
prior
to
chandler
's
research
,
some
sociologists
assumed
there
were
no
differences
between
governmental
,
corporate
,
and
nonprofit
organizations.
chandler
's
focus
on
corporations
clearly
demonstrated
that
there
were
differences
,
and
this
thesis
has
influenced
organizational
sociologists
'
work
since
the
late
<year>s.
it
also
motivated
sociologists
to
investigate
and
critique
chandler
's
work
more
closely
,
turning
up
instances
in
which
chandler
assumed
american
corporations
acted
for
reasons
of
efficiency
,
when
they
actually
operated
in
a
context
of
politics
or
conflict.

axelrod
(
may
<integer>
,
<year>
–
december
<integer>
,
<year>
)
was
an
american
biochemist.
he
won
a
share
of
the
nobel
prize
in
physiology
or
medicine
in
<year>
along
with
bernard
katz
and
ulf
von
euler.
the
nobel
committee
honored
him
for
his
work
on
the
release
and
reuptake
of
catecholamine
neurotransmitters
,
a
class
of
chemicals
in
the
brain
that
include
epinephrine
,
norepinephrine
,
and
,
as
was
later
discovered
,
dopamine.
axelrod
also
made
major
contributions
to
the
understanding
of
the
pineal
gland
and
how
it
is
regulated
during
the
sleep-wake
cycle.
==
education
and
early
life
==
axelrod
was
born
in
new
york
city
,
the
son
of
jewish
immigrants
from
poland
,
molly
(
née
leichtling
)
and
isadore
axelrod
,
a
basket
weaver.
he
received
his
bachelor
's
degree
in
biology
from
the
college
of
the
city
of
new
york
in
<year>.
axelrod
wanted
to
become
a
physician
,
but
was
rejected
from
every
medical
school
to
which
he
applied.
he
worked
briefly
as
a
laboratory
technician
at
new
york
university
,
then
in
<year>
he
got
a
job
with
the
new
york
city
department
of
health
and
mental
hygiene
testing
vitamin
supplements
added
to
food.
while
working
at
the
department
of
health
,
he
attended
night
school
and
received
his
master
's
in
sciences
degree
from
new
york
university
in
<year>.
==

===
analgesic
research
===
in
<year>
,
axelrod
took
a
position
working
under
bernard
brodie
at
goldwater
memorial
hospital.
the
research
experience
and
mentorship
axelrod
received
from
brodie
would
launch
him
on
his
research
career.
brodie
and
axelrod
's
research
focused
on
how
analgesics
(
pain-killers
)
work.
during
the
<year>s
,
users
of
non-aspirin
analgesics
were
developing
a
blood
condition
known
as
methemoglobinemia.
axelrod
and
brodie
discovered
that
acetanilide
,
the
main
ingredient
of
these
pain-killers
,
was
to
blame.
they
found
that
one
of
the
metabolites
also
was
an
analgesic.
they
recommended
that
this
metabolite
,
acetaminophen
(
paracetamol
,
tylenol
)
,
be
used
instead.
===
catecholamine
research
===
in
<year>
,
axelrod
began
work
at
the
national
heart
institute
,
forerunner
of
the
national
heart
,
lung
,
and
blood
institute
(
nhlbi
)
,
part
of
the
national
institutes
of
health
(
nih
)
.
he
examined
the
mechanisms
and
effects
of
caffeine
,
which
led
him
to
an
interest
in
the
sympathetic
nervous
system
and
its
main
neurotransmitters
,
epinephrine
and
norepinephrine.
during
this
time
,
axelrod
also
conducted
research
on
codeine
,
morphine
,
methamphetamine
,
and
ephedrine
and
performed
some
of
the
first
experiments
on
lsd.
realizing
that
he
could
not
advance
his
career
without
a
phd
,
he
took
a
leave
of
absence
from
the
nih
in
<year>
to
attend
george
washington
university
medical
school.
allowed
to
submit
some
of
his
previous
research
toward
his
degree
,
he
graduated
one
year
later
,
in
<year>.
axelrod
then
returned
to
the
nih
and
began
some
of
the
key
research
of
his
career.
axelrod
received
his
nobel
prize
for
his
work
on
the
release
,
reuptake
,
and
storage
of
the
neurotransmitters
epinephrine
and
norepinephrine
,
also
known
as
adrenaline
and
noradrenaline.
working
on
monoamine
oxidase
(
mao
)
inhibitors
in
<year>
,
axelrod
showed
that
catecholamine
neurotransmitters
do
not
merely
stop
working
after
they
are
released
into
the
synapse.
instead
,
neurotransmitters
are
recaptured
(
``
reuptake
''
)
by
the
pre-synaptic
nerve
ending
,
and
recycled
for
later
transmissions.
he
theorized
that
epinephrine
is
held
in
tissues
in
an
inactive
form
and
is
liberated
by
the
nervous
system
when
needed.
this
research
laid
the
groundwork
for
later
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(
ssris
)
,
such
as
prozac
,
which
block
the
reuptake
of
another
neurotransmitter
,
serotonin.
in
<year>
,
axelrod
also
discovered
and
characterized
the
enzyme
catechol-o-methyl
transferase
,
which
is
involved
in
the
breakdown
of
catecholamines.
===
pineal
gland
research
===
some
of
axelrod
's
later
research
focused
on
the
pineal
gland.
he
and
his
colleagues
showed
that
the
hormone
melatonin
is
generated
from
tryptophan
,
as
is
the
neurotransmitter
serotonin.
the
rates
of
synthesis
and
release
follows
the
body
's
circadian
rhythm
driven
by
the
suprachiasmatic
nucleus
within
the
hypothalamus.
axelrod
and
colleagues
went
on
to
show
that
melatonin
had
wide-ranging
effects
throughout
the
central
nervous
system
,
allowing
the
pineal
gland
to
function
as
a
biological
clock.
he
was
elected
a
fellow
of
the
american
academy
of
arts
and
sciences
in
<year>.
he
continued
to
work
at
the
national
institute
of
mental
health
at
the
nih
until
his
death
in

many
of
his

a
woman
and
a

criticized

male-dominated
field

jacobs
endured
scorn
from
established
figures.
routinely
,
she
was
described
first
as
a
housewife

as
she
did
not
have
a

degree
or
any
formal
training

as

her

served
as
a
judge
on
the
united

court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth

after
graduation
from
scranton
high
school
,
she
worked
for
a

,
during
the
great
depression
,
she
moved
to
new
york
city
with
her
sister
betty.
jane
butzner
took
an
immediate
liking
to
manhattan
's
greenwich
village
,
which
deviated
some
from
the
city
's
grid
structure.
the
sisters
soon
moved
there
from
brooklyn.during
her
early
years
in
manhattan
,
jacobs
held
a
variety
of
jobs
working
as
a
stenographer
and
freelance
writer
,
writing
about
working
districts
in
the
city.
these
experiences
,
she
later
said
,
``
gave
me
more
of
a
notion
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
city
and
what
business
was
like
,
what
work
was
like.
''
her
first
job
was
for
a
trade
magazine
,
as
a
secretary
,
then
an
editor.
she
sold
articles
to
the

,
law
,
political
science

and
economics.
about
the
freedom
to
pursue
study
across
her
wide-ranging
interests
,
she
said
:
for
the
first
time
i
liked
school
and
for
the
first
time
i
made
good
marks.
this
was
almost
my
undoing
because
after
i
had
garnered
,
statistically
,
a
certain
number
of
credits
i
became
the
property
of
barnard
college
at
columbia
,
and
once
i
was
the
property
of
barnard
i
had
to
take
,
it
seemed
,
what
barnard
wanted
me
to
take
,
not
what
i
wanted
to
learn.
fortunately
my
high-school
marks
had
been
so
bad
that
barnard
decided
i
could
not
belong
to
it
and
i
was
therefore
allowed
to
continue
getting
an
education.

career

after
attending
columbia
university
's
school
of
general
studies
for
two
years
,
butzner
found
a
job
at
iron
age
magazine.
her
<year>
article
on
economic
decline
in
scranton
was
well
publicized
and
led
the
murray
corporation
of
america
to
locate
a
warplane
factory
there.
encouraged
by
this
success
,
butzner
petitioned
the
war
production
board
to
support
more
operations
in
scranton.
experiencing
job
discrimination
at
iron
age
,
she
also
advocated
for
equal
pay
for
women
and
for
the
right
of
workers
to
unionize.

she
became
a
feature
writer
for
the
office
of
war
information
and
then
a
reporter
for
amerika
,
a
publication
of
the
u.s.
state
department.
while
working
there
she
met
robert
hyde
jacobs
jr.
,
a
columbia-educated
architect
who
was
designing
warplanes
for
grumman.
they
married
in
<year>.
together
they
had
a
daughter
,
burgin
,
and
two
sons
,
james
and
ned.
they
bought
a
three-story
building
at

hudson

jane
continued
to
write
for
america
after
the
war
,
while
robert
left
grumman
and
resumed
work
as
an
architect.the
jacobses
rejected
the
rapidly
growing
suburbs
as
``
parasitic
''
,
choosing
to
remain
in
greenwich
village.
they
renovated
their
house
,
in
the
middle
of
a
mixed
residential
and
commercial
area
,
and
created
a
garden
in
the
backyard.working
for
the
state
department
during
the
mccarthy
era
,
jacobs
received
a
questionnaire
about
her
political
beliefs
and
loyalties.
jacobs
was
anti-communist
and
had
left
the
federal
workers
union
because
of
its
apparent
communist
sympathies.
nevertheless
,
she
was
pro-union
and
purportedly
,
appreciated
the
writing
of
saul
alinsky
;
therefore
she
was
under
suspicion.
on
<day>
,
jacobs
delivered
her
response
to
conrad
e.
snow
,
chairman
of
the
loyalty
security
board
at
the
united
states
department
of
state.
in
her
foreword
to
her
answer
,
she
said
:
the
other
threat
to
the
security
of
our
tradition
,
i
believe
,
lies
at
home.
it
is
the
current
fear
of
radical
ideas
and
of
people
who
propound
them.
i
do
not
agree
with
the
extremists
of
either
the
left
or
the
right
,
but
i
think
they
should
be
allowed
to
speak
and
to
publish
,
both
because
they
themselves
have
,
and
ought
to
have
,
rights
,
and
once
their
rights
are
gone
,
the
rights
of
the

hardly
safe

she
then
found
a
well-paying
job
at

published
by
henry
luce
of

she
was
hired
as
an
associate
editor.
after
early
success
in
that
position
,
jacobs
began
to
take
assignments
on
urban
planning
and
``
urban
blight
''
.
in
<year>
,
she
was
assigned
to
cover
a
development
in
philadelphia
designed
by
edmund
bacon.
although
her
editors
expected
a
positive
story
,
jacobs
criticized
bacon
's
project
,
reacting
against
its
lack
of
concern
for
the
poor
african
americans
who
were
directly
affected.
when
bacon
showed
jacobs
examples
of
undeveloped
and
developed
blocks
,
she
determined
that
``
development
''
seemed
to
end
community
life
on
the
street.
when
jacobs
returned
to
the
offices
of
architectural
forum
,
she
began
to
question
the
<year>s
consensus
on
urban
planning.in
<year>
,
jacobs
met
william
kirk
,
an
episcopal
minister
who
worked
in
east

kirk
came
to
the
architectural
forum
offices
to
describe
the
impact

he
introduced

,
while
standing
in
for
douglas

jacobs
delivered
a
lecture
at

she
addressed
leading
architects
,
urban
planners
,
and
intellectuals
(
including
lewis
mumford
)
,
speaking
on
the
topic
of
east
harlem.
she
urged
this
audience
to
``
respect
–
in
the
deepest
sense
–
strips
of
chaos
that
have
a
weird
wisdom
of
their
own

in
our
concept
of
urban
order.
''
contrary
to
her
expectations
,
the
talk
was
received
with
enthusiasm
,
but
it
also
marked
her
as
a
threat
to
established
urban
planners
,
real

owners
,

william

invited
jacobs
to
write
an
article
for
fortune
magazine.
the
resulting
piece
,
``
downtown

people
''
,
appeared
in
a
<year>
issue
of
fortune
,
and
marked
her
first
public
criticism
of
robert
moses.
her
criticism
of
the
lincoln
center
was
not
popular
with
supporters
of
urban
renewal
at

and
fortune.
c.d.
jackson
,
the
publisher
of

,
was
outraged
and
over
the
telephone
,
demanded
of
whyte
:
``

this
crazy

the
fortune
article
brought
jacobs
to
the
attention
of
chadbourne
gilpatric
,
then
associate
director
of
the
humanities
division
at
the
rockefeller

the

had
moved
aggressively
into
urban

,
with
a
recent
award
to
the

that
would
culminate
in
the
publication

in
may
<year>
,
gilpatric
invited
jacobs
to
begin
serving
as
a
reviewer
for
grant
proposals.
later
that

,
the
rockefeller

awarded
a
grant
to

)
gilpatric
encouraged

to
``
explor

remains
one
of
the
most
influential

in

she
coined
the
terms
``
social
capital

,
``

``
eyes
on
the
street
''
,
which
were
adopted
professionally
in
urban
design
,
sociology
,
and
many
other
fields.
jacobs
painted
a
devastating
picture
of
the
profession
of
city
planning
,
labeling
it
a
pseudoscience.
this
angered
the
male-dominated
urban
planning
profession.
using
ad
hominem
attacks
,
jacobs
was
criticized
as
a
``
militant
dame
''
and
a
``
housewife
''
:
an
amateur
who
had
no
right
to
interfere
with

one
planner
dismissed

sent

called
it
``

also
libelous

else.
''
later
,
her
book
was
criticized
from
the
left
for
leaving
out
race
and
openly
endorsing
gentrification
,
which
jacobs
referred
to
as
``

she
became
an
opponent
of

,
marched
on

as

moses
had
shelved

revived

moses
argued
that

would
improve

provide

a
coalition

took
a

role
under
rubinow

reaching
out
to
media
outlets
such
as
the
village

which
provided
more

==
life
in
toronto
==
soon
after
her
arrest
in
<year>
,
jacobs
moved
to
toronto
,
eventually
settling
at
<integer>
albany
avenue
in
the
annex
from
<year>
until
her
death
in
<year>.
she
decided
to
leave
the
u.s.
in
part
because
she
opposed
the
vietnam
war
,
she
worried
about
the
fate
of
her
two
draft-age
sons
,
and
she
did
not
want
to
continue
fighting
the
new
york
city
government.
she
and
her
husband
chose
toronto
because
it
was
pleasant
and
offered
employment
opportunities
,
and
they
moved
to
an
area
of
toronto
that
included
so
many
americans
avoiding
the
draft
that
it
was
called
the
``
american
ghetto
''
.she
quickly
became
a
leading
figure
in
her
new
city
and
helped
stop
the
proposed
spadina
expressway.
a
frequent
theme
of
her
work
was
to
ask
whether
cities
were
being
built
for
people
or
for
cars.
she
was
arrested
twice
during
demonstrations.
she
also
had
considerable
influence
on
the
regeneration
of
the
st.
lawrence
neighborhood
,
a
housing
project
regarded
as
a
major
success.
she
became
a
canadian
citizen
in
<year>
and
later
,
she
told
writer
james
howard
kunstler
that
dual
citizenship
was
not
possible
at
the
time
,
implying
that
her
u.s.
citizenship
was
lost.in
<year>
,
she
offered
a
more
urban
perspective
on
quebec
's
sovereignty
in
her
book
,
the
question
of
separatism
:
quebec
and
the
struggle
over
separation.
jacobs
was
an
advocate
of
a
province
of
toronto
to
separate
the
city
proper
from
ontario.
jacobs
said
,
``
cities
,
to
thrive
in
the
twenty-first
century
,
must
separate
themselves
politically
from
their
surrounding
areas.
''
she
was
selected
to
be
an
officer
of
the
order
of
canada
in
<year>
for
her
seminal
writings
and
thought-provoking
commentaries
on
urban
development.
the
community
and
urban
sociology
section
of
the
american
sociological
association
awarded
her
its
outstanding
lifetime
contribution
award
in
<year>.
in
<year>
,
the
city
government
of
toronto
sponsored
a
conference
entitled
,
``
jane
jacobs
:
ideas
that
matter
''
,
which
led
to
a
book
by
the
same
name.
at
the
end
of
the
conference
,
the
jane
jacobs
prize
was
created.
it
includes
an
annual
stipend
of
$
<integer>
,
<integer>
for
three
years
to
be
given
to
``
celebrate

in
activities
that

to
the
city
's
vitality
''
.
jacobs
never
shied
away
from
expressing
her
political
support
for
specific
candidates.
she
opposed
the
<year>
amalgamation
of
the
cities
of
metro
toronto
,
fearing
that
individual
neighborhoods
would
have
less
power
with
the
new
structure.
she
backed
an
ecologist
,
tooker
gomberg
,
who
lost
toronto
's
<year>
mayoralty
race
,
and
she
was
an
adviser
to
david
miller
's
successful
mayoral
campaign
in
<year>
,
at
a
time
when
he
was
seen
as
a
longshot.
during
the
mayoral
campaign
,
jacobs
helped
lobby
against
the
construction
of
a
bridge
to
join
the
city
waterfront
to
toronto
city
centre
airport
(
tcca
)
.
following
the
election
,
the
toronto
city
council
's
earlier
decision
to
approve
the
bridge
was
reversed
and
bridge
construction
project
was
stopped.
tcca
did
upgrade
the
ferry
service
and
the
airport
was
still
in
operation
as
of
<year>.
in
lieu
of
the
bridge
,
a
pedestrian
tunnel
broke
ground
in
march
<year>.
the
tunnel
opened
on
<day>.
jacobs
also
was
active
in
a
campaign
against
a
plan
of
royal
st.
george
's
college
(
an
established
school
very
close
to
the
jacobs
residence
in
toronto
's
annex
district
)
to
reconfigure
its
facilities.
jacobs
suggested
not
only
that
the
redesign
be
stopped
but
that
the
school
be
forced
from
the
neighborhood
entirely.
although
toronto
council
initially
rejected
the
school
's
plans
,
the
decision
later
was
reversed
–
and
the
project
was
given
the
go-ahead
by
the
ontario
municipal
board
(
omb
)
when
opponents
failed
to
produce
credible
witnesses
and
tried
to
withdraw
from
the
case
during
the
hearing.she
also
had
an
influence
on
vancouver
's
urban
planning.
jacobs
has
been
called
``
the
mother
of
vancouverism
''
,
referring
to
that
city
's
use
of
her
``
density

''
philosophy.jacobs
died
in
toronto
western
hospital
aged

==
legacy
==
jacobs
is
credited
,
along
with
lewis
mumford
,
with
inspiring
the
new
urbanist
movement.
she
has
been
characterized
as
a
major
influence
on
decentralist
and
radical
centrist
thought.
she
discussed
her
legacy
in
an
interview
with
reason
magazine.
reason
:
what
do
you
think
you
'll
be
remembered
for
most
?
you
were
the
one
who
stood
up
to
the
federal
bulldozers
and
the
urban
renewal
people
and
said
they
were
destroying
the
lifeblood
of
these
cities.
is
that
what
it
will
be
?
jacobs
:
no.
if
i
were
to
be
remembered
as
a
really
important
thinker
of
the
century
,
the
most
important
thing
i
've
contributed
is
my
discussion
of
what
makes
economic
expansion
happen.
this
is
something
that
has
puzzled
people
always.
i
think
i
've
figured
out
what
it
is.
expansion
and
development
are
two
different
things.
development
is
differentiation
of
what
already
existed.
practically
every
new
thing
that
happens
is
a
differentiation
of
a
previous
thing
,
from
a
new
shoe
sole
to
changes
in
legal
codes.
expansion
is
an
actual
growth
in
size
or
volume
of
activity.
that
is
a
different
thing.
i
've
gone
at
it
two
different
ways.
way
back
when
i
wrote
the
economy
of
cities
,
i
wrote
about
import
replacing
and
how
that
expands
,
not
just
the
economy
of
the
place
where
it
occurs
,
but
economic
life
altogether.
as
a
city
replaces
imports
,
it
shifts
its
imports.
it
does
n't
import
less.
and
yet
it
has
everything
it
had
before.
reason
:
it
's
not
a
zero-sum
game.
it
's
a
bigger
,
growing
pie.
jacobs
:
that
's
the
actual
mechanism
of
it.
the
theory
of
it
is
what
i
explain
in
the
nature
of
economies.
i
equate
it
to
what
happens
with
biomass
,
the
sum
total
of
all
flora
and
fauna
in
an
area.
the
energy
,
the
material
that
's
involved
in
this
,
does
n't
just
escape
the
community
as
an
export.
it
continues
being
used
in
a
community
,
just
as
in
a
rainforest
the
waste
from
certain
organisms
and
various
plants
and
animals
gets
used
by
other
ones
in
the
place.
while
jacobs
saw
her
greatest
legacy
to
be
her
contributions
to
economic
theory
,
it
is
in
the
realm
of
urban
planning
that
she
has
had
her
most
extensive
effect.
her
observations
about
the
ways
in
which
cities
function
revolutionized
the
urban
planning
profession
and
discredited
many
accepted
planning
models
that
had
dominated
mid-century
planning.
the
influential
harvard
economist
edward
glaeser
,
known
for
his
work
on
urban
studies
,
acknowledged
that
jane
jacobs
(
<year>s
)
had
been
prescient
in
attacking
moses
for
``
replacing
well-functioning
neighborhoods
with
le
corbusier-inspired
towers
''
.
glaeser
agreed
that
these
housing
projects
proved
to
be
moses
'
greatest
failures
,
``
moses
spent
millions
and
evicted
tens
of
thousands
to
create
buildings
that
became
centers
of
crime
,
poverty
,
and
despair.
''
she
also
was
famous
for
introducing
concepts
such
as
the
``
ballet
of
the
sidewalk
''
and
``
eyes
on
the
street
''
,
a
reference
to
what
would
later
be
known
as
natural
surveillance.
the
concept
had
a
huge
influence
on
planners
and
architects
such
as
oscar
newman
,
who
prepared
the
idea
through
a
series
of
studies
that
would
culminate
in
his
defensible
space
theory.
the
work
of
jacobs
and
newman
would
go
on
to
affect
american
housing
policy
through
the
hope
vi
program
,
an
effort
by
the
united
states
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
to
demolish
the
high-rise
public
housing
projects
so
reviled
by
jacobs
and
to
replace
them
with
low-rise
,
mixed-income
housing.
throughout
her
life
,
jacobs
fought
to
alter
the
way
in
which
city
development
was
approached.
by
arguing
that
cities
were
living
beings
and
ecosystems
,
she
advocated
ideas
such
as
``
mixed
use
''
development
and
bottom-up
planning.
furthermore
,
her
harsh
criticisms
of
``
slum
clearing
''
and
``
high-rise
housing
''
projects
were
instrumental
in
discrediting
these
once
universally
supported
planning
practices.jacobs
is
remembered
as
being
an
advocate
for
the
mindful
development
of
cities
,
and
for
leaving
``
a
legacy
of
empowerment
for
citizens
to
trust
their
common
sense
and
become
advocates
for
their
place
''
.despite
the
fact
that
jacobs
mainly
focused
on
new
york
city
,
her
arguments
have
been
identified
as
universal.
for
instance
,
her
opposition
against
the
demolition
of
urban
neighborhoods
for
projects
of
urban
renewal
had
``
special
resonance
''
in
melbourne
,
australia.
in
melbourne
in
the
<year>s
,
resident
associations
fought
against
large-scale
high-rise
housing
projects
of
the
housing
commission
of
victoria
,
which
they
argued
had
little
regard
for
the
impact
on
local
communities.jacobs
fought
an
uphill
battle
against
dominant
trends
of
planning.
despite
the
united
states
remaining
very
much
a
suburban
nation
,
the
work
of
jacobs
has
contributed
to
city
living
being
rehabilitated
and
revitalized.
because
of
her
ideas
,
today
,
many
distressed
urban
neighborhoods
are
more
likely
to
be
gentrified
than
cleared
for
redevelopment.
it
may
be
that
we
have
become
so
feckless
as
a
people
that
we
no
longer
care
how
things
do
work
,
but
only
what
kind
of
quick
,
easy
outer
impression
they
give.
if
so
,
there
is
little
hope
for
our
cities
or
probably
for
much
else
in
our
society.
but
i
do
not
think
this
is
so.
in
her
book
'death
and
life
of
great
american
cities
,
'
written
in
<year>
,
ms.
jacobs
's
enormous
achievement
was
to
transcend
her
own
withering
critique
of
<integer>th-century
urban
planning
and
propose
radically
new
principles
for
rebuilding
cities.
at
a
time
when
both
common
and
inspired
wisdom
called
for
bulldozing
slums
and
opening
up
city
space
,
ms.
jacobs
's
prescription
was
ever
more
diversity
,
density
and
dynamism
–
in
effect
,
to
crowd
people
and
activities
together
in
a
jumping
,
joyous
urban
jumble.

criticism
==
the
planners
and
developers
she
fought
against
to
preserve
the
west
village
were
among
those
who
initially
criticized
her
ideas.
robert
moses
has
generally
been
identified
as
her
arch-rival
during
this
period.
since
then
,
jacobs
'
ideas
have
been
analysed
many
times
,
often
in
regard
to
the
outcomes
that
their
influences
have
produced.in
places
such
as
the
west
village
,
the
factors
that
she
argued
would
maintain
economic
and
cultural
diversity
have
led
instead
to
gentrification
and
some
of
the
most
expensive
real
estate
in
the
world.
her
family
's
conversion
of
an
old
candy
shop
into
a
home
is
an
example
of
the
gentrifying
trend
that
would
continue
under
the
influence
of
jacobs
's
ideas.gentrification
also
was
caused
,
however
,
by
``
the
completely
unexpected
influx
of
affluent
residents
back
into
the
inner
city
''
.
the
extent
to
which
her
ideas
facilitated
this
phenomenon
was
at
the
time
unimaginable.
for
example
,
she
advocated
the
preservation
of
older
buildings
specifically
because
their
lack
of
economic
value
made
them
affordable
for
poor
people.
in
this
respect
,
she
saw
them
as
``
guarantors
of
social
diversity
''
.
that
many
of
these
older
structures
have
increased
in
economic
value
solely
due
to
their
age
was
implausible
in
<year>.
issues
of
gentrification
have
dominated
criticism
of
jane
jacobs
'
planning
ideas.economist
tyler
cowen
has
criticized
her
ideas
for
not
addressing
problems
of
scale
or
infrastructure
,
and
suggests
that
economists
disagree
with
some
of
her
approaches
to
development.
for
example
,
although
her
ideas
of
planning
were
praised
at
times
as
``
universal
''
,
they
are
now
thought
inapplicable
when
a
city
grows
from
one
million
to
ten
million
(
as
has
happened
many
times
in
developing
nations
)
.
such
arguments
suggest
that
her
ideas
apply
only
to
cities
with
similar
issues
to
those
of
new
york
,
where
jacobs
developed
many
of
them.

the
death
and
life
of

is
her
single-most
influential
book
and
,
possibly
,
the
most
influential
book
on
urban
planning
and
cities.
published
in
<year>
,
this
book
was
widely
read
by
both
planning
professionals
and
the
general
public.
the
book
is
a
strong
critique
of
the
urban
renewal
policies
of
the
<year>s
,
which
,
she
claimed
,
destroyed
communities
and
created
isolated
,
unnatural
urban
spaces.
in
the
book
,
she
celebrates
the
diversity
and
complexity
of
old-mixed
use
neighborhoods
while
lamenting
the
monotony
and
sterility
of
modern
planning.
jacobs
advocated
the
abolition
of
zoning
laws
and
restoration
of
free
markets
in
land
,
which
would
result
in
dense
,
mixed-use
neighborhoods
and
she
frequently
cited
new
york
city
's
greenwich
village
as
an
example
of
a
vibrant
urban
community.
robert
caro
has
cited
it
as
the
strongest
influence
on
the
power
broker
,
his
pulitzer-winning
biography
of
robert
moses
,
although
caro
does
not
mention
jacobs
by
name
in
the
book
despite
jacobs
'
battles
with
moses
over
his
proposed
lower
manhattan
expressway.
caro
reportedly
cut
a
chapter
about
jacobs
due
to
his
book
's
length.beyond
the
practical
lessons
in
city
design
and
planning
that
death
and
life
offers
,
the
theoretical
underpinnings
of
the
work
challenge
the
modern
development
mindset.
jane
jacobs
defends
her
positions
with
common
sense
and
anecdotes.
===
the
economy
of
cities
===
the
thesis
of
this
book
is
that
cities
are
the
primary
drivers
of
economic
development.
her
main
argument
is
that
explosive
economic
growth
derives
from
urban
import
replacement.
import
replacement
is
the
process
of
producing
goods
locally
that
formerly
were
imported
,
e.g.
,
tokyo
bicycle
factories
replacing
tokyo
bicycle
importers
in
the
<year>s.
jacobs
claims
that
import
replacement
builds
up
local
infrastructure
,
skills
,
and
production.
jacobs
also
claims
that
the
increased
production
is
subsequently
exported
to
other
cities
,
giving
those
other
cities
a
new
opportunity
to
engage
in
import
replacement
,
thus
producing
a
positive
cycle
of
growth.
in
an
interview
with
bill
steigerwald
in
reason
magazine
,
jacobs
said
that
if
she
is
remembered
for
being
a
great
intellectual
she
will
be
remembered
not
for
her
work
concerning
city
planning
,
but
for
the
discovery
of
import
replacement.
critics
erroneously
claim
that
her
ideas
parrot
the
idea
of
import
substitution
advanced
earlier
by
scholars
such
as
andre
gunder
frank.
import
substitution
was
a
national
economic
theory
implying
that
if
a
nation
substituted
its
imports
with
national
production
,
the
nation
would
become
wealthier
,
whereas
jacob
's
idea
is
entirely
about
cities
and
could
be
called
urban
import
substitution.
however
,
even
this
would
lead
to
confusion
since
in
practice
,
import
substitution
in
india
and
latin
america
were
government
subsidized
and
mandated
,
whereas
jacobs
'
concept
of
import
replacement
is
a
free
market
process
of
discovery
and
division
of
labor
within
a
city.in
the
second
part
of
the
book
,
jacobs
argues
that
cities
preceded
agriculture.
she
argues
that
in
cities
trade
in
wild
animals
and
grains
allowed
for
the
initial
division
of
labor
necessary
for
the
discovery
of
husbandry
and
agriculture
;
these
discoveries
then
moved
out
of
the
city
due
to
land
competition.
another
interpretation
of
history
,
generally
and
erroneously
considered
to
be
contradictory
to
jacobs
'
is
supported
by
marxist
archaeologist
vere
gordon
childe
and
in
recent
times
,
by
another
historical
materialist
charles
keith
maisels
these
writers
argue
that
agriculture
preceded
cities.
the
apparent
opposition
between
childe
and
jacobs
theories
rests
in
their
definition
of
'city
'
,
'civilization
'
,
or
'urban'.
childe
,
like
other
materialists
such
as
maisels
or
henri
lefebvre
defines
'urban
'
or
'civilization
'
as
synoecism—as
a
literate
,
socially
stratified
,
monolithic
political
community
,
whereas
,
as
one
can
see
from
the
economy
of
cities
or
from
cities
and
the
wealth
of
nations
,
jacobs
defines
the
city
purely
along
the
lines
of
geographically
dense
trade
giving
way
to
entrepreneurial
discovery
and
subsequent
improvements
in
the
division
of
labor.
without
the
requirements
of
literacy
,
monumental
building
,
or
the
signs
of
specialized
civil
and
armed
forces
,
'cities
'
can
be
accurately
be
interpreted
to
exists
thousands
of
years
before
when
childe
and
maisels
place
them.
however
,
the
jacobs
definition
is
supposition
,
since
'city
'
is
defined
simply
as
a
large
town
or
``
a
large
human
settlement
''
indicating
permanence.
the
earliest
remains
of
mankind
uncovered
by
archaeologists
do
not
give
us
more
information
other
than
that
they
were
hunter-gatherers
as
there
is
no
evidence
yet
of
farming
or
settlement
,
implying
nomadic
lifestyles
until
further
discoveries
are
found.

cities
and

it
was
published
in
<year>
and
reprinted
in
<year>
with
a
previously-unpublished
<year>
interview
with
robin
philpot
on
the
subject
in
which
she
evokes
the
relative
overlooking
of
that
book
among
her
usual
readership.
this
was
the
first
time
jacobs
was
requested
to
discuss
it
in
an
interview.
columnist
richard
gwyn
advanced
that
while
not
openly
criticizing
her
,
english-speaking
canadians
readers
thought
she
did
not
understood
how
canadian
politics
worked
and
that
she
was
not
being
helpful
in
a
time
of
distress
for
national
unity
(
the
<year>
referendum
was
just
defeated
by
a
vote
of
<integer>
%
)
.
the
question
of
separatism
was
also
not
mentioned
in
the
bibliography
of
her
<year>
obituary
in
the
globe
and
mail.jacobs
'
book
advances
the
view
that
quebec
's
eventual
independence
is
best
for
montreal
,
toronto
,
the
rest
of
canada
,
and
the
world
;
and
that
such
independence
can
be
achieved
peacefully.
as
precedent
,
she
cites
norway
's
secession
from
sweden
and
how
it
enriched
both
nations.
the
origins
of
the
contemporary
secessionist-movement
in
the
quiet
revolution
are
examined
,
along
with
canada
's
historical
reliance
on
natural
resources
and
foreign-owned
manufacturing
for
its
own
economic
development.
jacobs
asserts
that
such
an
approach
is
colonial
and
hence
backward
,
citing
by
example
,
canada
buying
its
skis
and
furniture
from
norway
or
norwegian-owned
factories
in
canada
,
the
latter
procedure
being
a
product
of
canadian
tariffs
designed
specifically
to
foster
such
factories.
the
relevant
public
views
of
rené
lévesque
,
claude
ryan
,
and
then
prime
minister
pierre
trudeau
are
also
critically
analyzed
,
an
example
being
their
failure
to
recognize
that
two
respective
,
independent
currencies
are
essential
to
the
success
of
an
independent
quebec
and
a
smaller
resultant
canada
,
an
issue
that
is
central
to
her
book.
jacobs
stresses
the
need
for
montreal
to
continue
developing
its
leadership
of
québécois
culture
,
but
that
ultimately
,
such
a
need
can
never
be
fulfilled
by
montreal
's
increasing
tendencies
toward
regional-city
status
,
tendencies
foretelling
economic
,
political
,
and
cultural
subservience
to
english-speaking
toronto.
such
an
outcome
,
jacobs
believed
,
would
in
the
long
run
doom
quebec
's
independence
as
much
as
it
would
hinder
canada
's
own
future.
she
concludes
with
her
observation
that
the
popular
equating
of
political
secession
with
political
and
economic
failure
is
the
result
of
the
enlightenment
,
which
perceived
nature
as
a
force
for
``
standardization
,
uniformity
,
universality
,
and
immutability.
''
since
then
,
naturalists
and
their
readers
have
gradually
realized
that
nature
is
a
force
for
diversity
,
and
that
,
``
diversity
itself
is
of
the
essence
of
excellence.
''
the
right
kind
of
secession
,
jacobs
states
,
can
lead
to
the
right
kind
of
diversity
,
and
quebec
and
canada
are
capable
of
both
,
and
must
achieve
both
,
to
survive.

great
american
cities
did
for
modern
urban
planning
,
although
it
has
not
received
the
same
critical
attention.
beginning
with
a
concise
treatment
of
classical
economics
,
this
book
challenges
one
of
the
fundamental
assumptions
of
the
greatest
economists.
classical
(
and
neo-classical
)
economists
consider
the
nation-state
to
be
the
main
player
in
macroeconomics.
jacobs
argues
that
it
is
not
the
nation-state
,
rather
it
is
the
city
that
is
the
true
player
in
this
worldwide
game.
she
restates
the
idea
of
import
replacement
from
her
earlier
book
the
economy
of
cities
,
while
speculating
on
the
further
ramifications
of
considering
the
city
first
and
the
nation
second
,
or
not
at
all.

systems
of
survival
:
a
dialogue
on
the
moral
foundations
of
commerce
and
politics
moves
outside
of
the
city
,
studying
the
moral
underpinnings
of
work.
as
with
her
other
work
,
she
used
an
observational
approach.
this
book
is
written
as
a
platonic
dialogue.
it
appears
that
she
(
as
described
by
characters
in
her
book
)
took
newspaper
clippings
of
moral
judgments
related
to
work
,
collected
and
sorted
them
to
find
that
they
fit
two
patterns
of
moral
behavior
that
were
mutually
exclusive.
she
calls
these
two
patterns
``
moral
syndrome
a
''
,
or
commercial
moral
syndrome
,
and
``
moral
syndrome
b
''
,
or
guardian
moral
syndrome.
she
claims
that
the
commercial
moral
syndrome
is
applicable
to
business
owners
,
scientists
,
farmers
,
and
traders.
similarly
,
she
claims
that
the
guardian
moral
syndrome
is
applicable
to
government
,
charities
,
hunter-gatherers
,
and
religious
institutions.
she
also
claims
that
these
moral
syndromes
are
fixed
,
and
do
not
fluctuate
over
time.
it
is
important
to
stress
that
jane
jacobs
is
providing
a
theory
about
the
morality
of
work
,
and
not
all
moral
ideas.
moral
ideas
that
are
not
included
in
her
system
are
applicable
to
both
syndromes.
jane
jacobs
goes
on
to
describe
what
happens
when
these
two
moral
syndromes
are
mixed
,
showing
the
work
underpinnings
of
the
mafia
and
communism
,
and
what
happens
when
new
york
subway
police
are
paid
bonuses
here
–
reinterpreted
slightly
as
a
part
of
the
larger
analysis.
===
the
nature
of
economies
===
the
nature
of
economies
,
a
dialog
between
friends
concerning
the
premise
:
``
human
beings
exist
wholly
within
nature
as
part
of
the
natural
order
in
every
respect
''
(
p.
ix
)
,
argues
that
the
same
principles
underlie
both
ecosystems
and
economies
:
``
development
and
co-development
through
differentiation
and
their
combinations
;
expansion
through
diverse
,
multiple
uses
of
energy
;
and
self-maintenance
through
self-refueling
''
(
p.
<integer>
)
.
jacobs
also
comments
on
the
nature
of
economic
and
biological
diversity
and
its
role
in
the
development
and
growth
of
the
two
kinds
of
systems.
jacobs
'
characters
discuss
the
four
methods
by
which
``
dynamically
stable
systems
''
may
evade
collapse
:
``
bifurcations
;
positive-feedback
loops
;
negative-feedback
controls
;
and
emergency
adaptations
''
(
p.
<integer>
)
.
their
conversations
also
cover
the
``
double
nature
of
fitness
for
survival
''
(
traits
to
avoid
destroying
one
's
own
habitat
as
well
as
success
in
competition
to
feed
and
breed
,
p.
<integer>
)
,
and
unpredictability
including
the
butterfly
effect
characterized
in
terms
of
multiplicity
of
variables
as
well
as
disproportional
response
to
cause
,
and
self-organization
where
``
a
system
can
be
making
itself
up
as
it
goes
along
''
(
p.
<integer>
)
.
the
book
is
infused
with
many
real-world
economic
and
biological
examples
,
which
help
keep
the
book
``
down
to
earth
''
and
comprehensible
,
if
dense.
concepts
are
furnished
with
both
economic
and
biological
examples
,
showing
their
coherence
in
both
worlds.
one
particularly
interesting
insight
is
the
creation
of
``
something
from
nothing
''
–
an
economy
from
nowhere.
in
the
biological
world
,
free
energy
is
given
through
sunlight
,
but
in
the
economic
world
human
creativity
and
natural
resources
supply
this
free
energy
,
or
at
least
starter
energy.
another
interesting
insight
is
the
creation
of
economic
diversity
through
the
combination
of
different
technologies
,
for
example
the
typewriter
and
television
as
inputs
and
outputs
of
a
computer
system
:
this
can
lead
to
the
creation
of
``
new
species
of
work
''
.

dark
age

posits
jacobs
'
argument
that
``
north
american
''
civilization
shows
signs
of
a
spiral
decline
comparable
to
the
collapse
of
the
roman
empire.
her
discussion
focuses
on
``
five
pillars
of
our
culture
that
we
depend
on
to
stand
firm
''
,
which
can
be
summarized
as
the
nuclear
family
and
community
;
quality
in
education
;
free
thought
in
science
;
representational
government
and
responsible
taxes
;
and
corporate
and
professional
accountability.
as
the
title
of
this
book
suggests
,
jacobs
'
outlook
is
far
more
pessimistic
than
that
of
her
previous
works.
however
,
in
the
conclusion
she
admits
:
``
at
a
given
time
it
is
hard
to
tell
whether
forces
of
cultural
life
or
death
are
in
the
ascendancy.
is
suburban
sprawl
,
with
its
murders
of
communities
and
wastes
of
land
,
time
,
and
energy
,
a
sign
of
decay
?
or
is
rising
interest
in
means
of
overcoming
sprawl
a
sign
of
vigor
and
adaptability
in
north
american
culture
?
arguably
,
either
could
turn
out
to
be
true.
''
while
jacobs
idealized
u.s.
democracy
,
dark
age
ahead
echoes
the
skepticism
and
disappointment
that
led
to
her
emigration
to
canada
in
<year>.
later
,
she
would
indicate
that
north
american
cultures
,
among
others
,
were
grounded
in
a
``
plantation
mentality
''
that
was
culturally
and
ecologically
unsustainable.

neumann
began
organizing

mathematics
as
she
saw
it.
she
was
able

much
more
thoroughly
reflected
her

his
<year>
autobiographical
essay
``
curiosity
,
milieu
and
era
''
,
dethier
attributed
his
interest
in
insects
,
which
would
become
a
central
aspect
of
his
research
career
,
to
a
childhood
encounter
with
a
butterfly
in
a
neighborhood
park
known
as
``
the
oval
''
:
i
had
wandered
up
to
the
oval
late
one
hot
,
humid
,
summer
day.
the
long
,
slanting
rays
of
the
sun
illuminated
my
white
shirt.
suddenly
,
something
rocketed
across
the
street
,
made
a
few
zigzags
,
and
landed
on
my
shirt
,
just
above
the
pocket.
i
stood
stock-still
and
slowly
lowered
my
head
to
see
what
it
was.
there
with
its
wings
slowly
expanding
clung
a
brown
butterfly
with
a
red
band
extending
down
each
wing.
this
red
admiral
was
the
first
live
butterfly
i
had
ever
seen
at
close
range
,
and
i
was
fascinated.

born
on

,
argentina
,
the
son
of

harnett
harrisson
(
<year>–<year>

,
an
engineer
,
and
marie
ellen
cole
(
<year>–<year>
)
.
another
son
,
william
damer
harrisson
,
was
born
in
<year>.
the
family
lived
in
concordia
,
entre
ríos
where
his
father
had
been
working
as
a
railway
engineer
and
then
manager
since
<year>.
in
<year>
,
at
the
start
of
the
first
world
war
,
the
family
sailed
to
the
united
kingdom
where
geoffry
harrisson
joined
the
british
army.
he
was
highly
decorated
for
his
service
and
eventually
rose
to
the
rank
of
brigadier-general.harrisson
was
socially
isolated
throughout
these
early
years
,
with
no
friends
apart
from
his
brother.
his
father
was
away
in
the
army
,
and
his
mother
showed
little
interest
in
her
children.
the
family
moved
frequently
,
and
harrisson
later
recalled
no
``
lived
in
,
loved
place
''
.
with
no
toys
to
occupy
them
,
their
nanny
kitty
asbury
entertained
her
charges
with
long
country
walks
,
which
stimulated
a
great
interest
in
nature.
harrisson
had
learnt
to
read
by
the
age
of
five
by
studying
asbury
's
books
on
natural
history.in
<year>
,
harrisson
's
parents
moved
back
to
argentina
,
``
dumping
''
–
as
harrisson
later
described
it
–
their
sons
at
eastacre
preparatory
school
and
later
winton
house
preparatory
school
,
winchester.
school
holidays
were
spent
unhappily
as
paying
guests
at
various
vicarages.
there
was
a
brief
interlude
during
<year>
and
<year>
,
when
harrisson
and
his
brother
were
taken
back
to
argentina
by
their
father.
it
was
to
be
the
best
year
of
his
childhood.
with
his
father
as
teacher
,
he
learnt
to
hunt
,
fly-fish
and
climb.
he
became
interested
in
birds
:
he
built
an
aviary
and
studied
their
behaviour.
socially
and
linguistically
isolated
in
argentina
,
he
also
felt
a
stranger
in
england
,
even
more
so
after
his
year
in
south
america.
in
a
<year>
radio
interview
,
he
reflected
on
this
period
,
and
stated
that
``
this
feeling
both
of
belonging
intensely
,
emotionally
,
sentimentally
with
england
and
yet
of
not
belonging
to
it
and
finding
its
habits
and
its
people
and
its
voices
and
its
faces
strange
keeps
on
producing
sensations
even
to
this
day
of
strangeness
wherever
i
go
''
.harrisson
attended
harrow
school
from
<year>
to
<year>
,
a
boarder
in
the
house
of
his
sympathetic
godfather
,
rev.
d.
b.
kittermaster
,
who
was
particularly
supportive
of
boys
such
as
harrisson
who
were
rebellious
and
did
not
fit
in.
harrisson
had
little
interest
in
interacting
with
his
fellow
schoolboys
,
but
nevertheless
took
an
intense
interest
in
them
,
keeping
a
card
index
on
every
boy.
he
was
also
fascinated
by
issues
of
hierarchy
and
status
at
the
school.
he
continued
his
interest
in
ornithology
,
and
supported
by
his
housemaster

to
roam
beyond
the
school
grounds

wrote
and
published
a
book
on
birds
of
the

organized
<integer>
other
birdwatchers
in
a
pioneering
census
of
the
great
crested
grebe.
the
census
later
became
a
fixture
of
british
birdwatching
,
and
brought
him
in
contact
with
many
of
the
leading
figures
of
natural
sciences
when
he
continued
his
education
at
pembroke
college
,
cambridge.
harrisson
enjoyed
friendship
with

stipendium
,
but
was
unable

she
was
nevertheless
able
to
pursue

career
,
working
with
jürgen
kuczynski
,
a
distinguished
economist
and
,
like
her
,
a
refugee
from

the
focus
of

was
a
study
entitled
``

,
which
in
the
end
was
published
in
<year>
,
and
concerned
the
economic
policy
of
the
fascist
states.
the
authors
attacked
the
widespread
contention
that
the
economy
in
nazi
germany
was
unusually
efficient.
it
was
their
view
that
labour
output
was
lower
and
the
accident
rate
was
higher
than
before

and
that
earnings
growth

reduced

material
costs
,
a
reduction
in
emphasis
on
consumer
goods
and
an
extension
of
working
hours.
there
was
also
a
warning
directed
at
the
united
states
(
at
this
stage
still
not
militarily
involved
against
germany
)
that
successful
conquest
by
nazi
germany
of
europe
and
the
soviet
union
would
give
rise
to
a
fascist
european
bloc
capable
of

cheap
manufactured
goods.remarkably

travel

while
taking
care

hasten
back

when
the
situation
appeared
to
be
becoming
too
dangerous.
in

she
moved
to

co-produced

the

sources
nevertheless
indicate
that
wittkowski
objected

work
as

she
wished
to
contribute
more
directly
to
rebuilding
the

wittkowski
was
transferred
to
the
consumer
co-operatives
association

an
office
she
held
till
<year>.
this
was
a
demotion
,
attributed
by
one
source
to
an
emulation
by
walter
ulbricht
of
stalin
's
<year>
purge
of
``
zionist
conspirators
''

others
,
referring

are

``
those

more
likely
to
be
considered

''
.
whatever
the
reason
for
her
removal
from
the
german
economic
commission
,
it
does
appear
that
wittkowski
was
respected
for
her
formidable
intellect
,
which
unlike
others
she
was
sometimes
willing
to
deploy
in
discussions
involving
walter
ulbricht
,
the
country
's
leader.after
stalin
died
,
in
march
<year>
,
the
east
german

became
slightly
less
nervous
,
and
in
<year>
she
was
reinstated
as
deputy
president
of
what
had
now
become
the
state
planning
commission
,
which
gave
her
significant
influence
over
national
economic
policy.
in

wittkowski
was
also
elected
a
member
of
the
powerful
party
central

,
which
under

employed
in

was
the
real
focus

also
sat
as

(
``

between
<year>
and
<year>
,
and
again
between
<year>
and
<year>.between
<year>
and
<year>
,
wittkowski
found
herself
increasingly
out
of
line
with
the
leadership
,
both
because
of
differences
over
aspects
of
economic
policy
and
because
she
sought
to
open
a
spirit
of
wider
debate.
in
a
speech
delivered
on
<day>
to
the
central
committee
plenum
she
criticised
ulbricht
over
his
failure
to
brief
central
committee
members
on
the
momentous
events
at
the
soviet
<integer>th
party
congress
in
moscow
the
previous
month
:
she
urged
a
little
more
openness
within
the
east
german
central
committee.
wittkowski
advocated
greater
priority
be
given
to
profitability
and
the
needs
of
the
population.
at
the
central
committee
plenum
in
november
<year>
she
called
for
greater
decentralisation
of
economic
decision
making.
addressing
the
central
committee
plenum
in
november
<year>
,
she
criticised
the
``
bureaucratic
''
actions
of
many
functionaries
,
which
she
characterised
as
discrediting
the
``
party
and
the
government
''
.
she
also
appealed
for
a
less
confrontational
policy
with
socialists
in
the
german
federal
republic
,
where
a
court
imposed
ban
on
the
communist
party
in
august
<year>
failed
to
trigger
significant
protests
by
west
german
workers.
there
were
two
german
states
but
there
was
only
one
german
working
class.
wittkowski
might
have
taken
a
lead
within
the
central
committee
in
criticising
aspects
of
economic
policy
,
but
she
was
not
a
lone
voice.
inside
the
central
committee
,
karl
schirdewan
and
ernst
wollweber
were
voicing
similar
sentiments.
other
prominent
critics
of
the
party
line
were
gerhart
ziller
,
fred
oelßner
and
fritz
selbmann.however
,
whereas
wittkowski
saw
in
the
social
democratic
party
(
spd
)
in
west
germany
a
potential
ally
in
support
of
workers
and
in
opposition
to
the
adenauer
régime
,
ulbricht
saw
the
western
spd
,
even
before
publication
in
<year>
of
the
godesberg
program
,
as
irredeemably
counter-revolutionary.
the
idea
that
one
might
``
do
business
''
with
them
was
a
repudiation
of
valued
stalinist
dogma.
more
generally
,
he
was
underwhelmed
by
her
economic
and
other
criticisms.
her
advocacy
of
``
socialist
self-management
''
led
to
a
charge
of
``
managerism
''
.
in
february
<year>
the
central
committee
plenum
endorsed
the
orthodox
line
advocated
by
general
secretary
ulbricht
:
wittkowski
underwent
a
``
temporary
demotion
''
.
(
for
the
other
critics
named
in
the
previous
paragraph
demotion
was
permanent
)
she
was
removed
from
her
deputy
presidency
of
the
state
planning
commission
and
her
name
was
no
longer
included
on
the
party
list
for
the
volkskammer
election
that
year.
she
was
also
resigned
from
the
central
committee
,
although
her
name
now
appeared
on
the
list
of
candidates
for
central
committee
membership
,
an
indulgence
not
afforded
to
comrades
schirdewan
and
wollweber.she
was
quickly
restored
to
the
state
planning
commission
vice-presidency
,
although
now
there
was
more
than
one
vice-president
so
that
her
relative
stature
within
the
body
was
diminished.
a
few
years
later
,
after
<year>
,
the
economic
reforms
branded
as
the
``
new
economic
system
''
,
reflecting
a
modest
loosening
of
centralised
control
across
the
entire
``
eastern
bloc
''
seemed
to
acknowledge
concerns
that
had
been
expressed
by
wittkowski
three
years
before.
she
herself
remained
at

point
outside

a
for
the
first
time.
for
nearly
a
decade
from
<year>
on
he
was
the
world
's
only
radio
astronomer
,
a
field
that
only
expanded
after
world
war
two
when
scientists
,
who
had
gained
a
great
deal
of
knowledge
during
the
wartime
expansion
of
radar
,
entered
the
field
,
starting
with
project
diana.
during
this
time
he
uncovered
a
mystery
that
was
not
explained
until
the
<year>s.
the
standard
theory
of
radio
emissions
from
space
was
that
they
were
due
to
black-body
radiation
,
light
(
of
which
radio
is
a
non-visible
form
)
that
is
given
off
by
all
hot
bodies.
using
this
theory
one
would
expect
that
there
would
be
considerably
more
high-energy
light
than
low-energy
,
due
to
the
presence
of
stars
and
other
hot
bodies.
however
reber
demonstrated
that
the
reverse
was
true
,
and
that
there
was
a
considerable
amount
of
low-energy
radio
signal.
it
was
not
until
the
<year>s
that
synchrotron
radiation
was
offered
as
an
explanation
for
these
measurements.
reber
sold
his
telescope
to
the
national
bureau
of
standards
,
and
it
was
erected
on
a
turntable
at
their
field
station
in
sterling
,
virginia.
eventually
the
telescope
made
its
way
to
the
national
radio
astronomy
observatory
in
green
bank
,
west
virginia
,
and
reber
supervised
its
reconstruction
at
that
site.
reber
also
helped
with
a
reconstruction
of
jansky
's
original
telescope.
===
medium
frequency
research
===
starting
in
<year>
,
he
received
generous
support
from
the
research
corporation
in
new
york
,
and
moved
to
hawaii.
in
the
<year>s
,
he
wanted
to
return
to
active
studies
but
much
of
the
field
was
already
filled
with
very
large
and
expensive
instruments.
instead
he
turned
to
a
field
that
was
being
largely
ignored
,
that
of
medium
frequency
(
hectometre
)
radio
signals
in
the
<decimal>–<integer>
mhz
range
,
around
the
am
broadcast
bands.
however
,
signals
with
frequencies
below
<integer>
mhz
are
reflected
by
an
ionized
layer
in
the
earth
's
atmosphere
called
the
ionosphere.
in
<year>
,
reber
moved
to
tasmania
,
the
southernmost
state
of
australia
,
where
he
worked
with
bill
ellis
at
the
university
of
tasmania.
there
,
on
very
cold
,
long
,
winter
nights
the
ionosphere
would
,
after
many
hours
shielded
from
the
sun
's
radiation
by
the
bulk
of
the
earth
,
'quieten
'
and
de-ionize
,
allowing
the
longer
radio
waves
into
his
antenna
array.
reber
described
this
as
being
a
``
fortuitous
situation
''
.
tasmania
also
offered
low
levels
of
man-made
radio
noise
,
which
permitted
reception
of
the
faint
signals
from
outer
space.
in
the
<year>s
,
he
had
an
array
of
dipoles
set
up
on
the
sheep
grazing
property
of
dennistoun
,
about
<decimal>
km
northeast
of
the
town
of
bothwell
,
tasmania
,
where
he
lived
in
a
house
of
his
own
design
and
construction
he
decided
to
build
after
he
purchased
a
job
lot
of
coach
bolts
at
a
local
auction.
he
imported
<integer>x8
douglas
fir
beams
directly
from
a
sawmill
in
oregon
,
and
then
high
technology
double
glazed
window
panes
,
also
from
the
us.
the
bolts
held
the
house
together.
the
window
panes
formed
a
north
facing
passive
solar
wall
,
heating
mat
black
painted
,
dimpled
copper
sheets
,
from
which
the
warmed
air
rose
by
convection.
the
interior
walls
were
lined
with
reflective
rippled
aluminium
foil.
the
house
was
so
well
thermally
insulated
that
the
oven
in
the
kitchen
was
nearly
unusable
because
the
heat
from
it
,
unable
to
escape
,
would
raise
the
temperature
of
the
room
to
over
<integer>
°c
(
<integer>
°f
)
.
===
final
years
===
his
house
was
never
completely
finished.
it
was
meant
to
have
a
passive
heat
storage
device
,
in
the
form
of
a
thermally
insulated
pit
full
of
dolerite
rocks
,
underneath
,
but
although
his
mind
was
sharp
,
his
body
started
to
fail
him
in
his
later
years
,
and
he
was
never
able
to
move
the
rocks.
he
was
fascinated
by
mirrors
and
had
at
least
one
in
every
room.
he
had
one
of
the
amplifiers
from
the
prime
focus
of
his
first
telescope
,
probably
the
one
used
at
<integer>
mhz.
it
was
of
compact
point-to-point
construction
and
used
two
r.c.a.
type
<integer>
``
acorn
''
thermionic
valves.
all
the
rubber-insulated
wires
in
it
had
perished
and
the
rubber
was
hard
and
crumbly.
he
powered
this
amplifier
,
and
all
his
later
receivers
at
dennistoun
,
from
batteries
,
to
avoid
interference
entering
the
equipment
along
power
cables.
reber
was
not
a
believer
of
the
big
bang
theory
;
he
believed
that
red
shift
was
due
to
repeated
absorption
and
re-emission
or
interaction
of
light
and
other
electromagnetic
radiations
by
low
density
dark
matter
,
over
intergalactic
distances
,
and
he
published
an
article
called
``
endless
,
boundless
,
stable
universe
''
,
which
outlined
his
theory.
reber
was
supportive
of
the
tired
light
explanation
for
the
redshift-distance
relationship.he
was
looked
after
in
his
final
days
at
the
ouse
district
hospital
,
about
<integer>
km
northwest
of
hobart
,
tasmania
,
where
he
died
in
<year>
,
two
days
before
his

kantorovich
was
born
on
<day>
,
to
a
russian
jewish
family.
his
father
was
a
doctor
practicing
in
saint
petersburg.
in
<year>
,
at
the
age
of
fourteen
,
he
began
his
studies
at
leningrad
state
university.
he
graduated
from
the
faculty
of
mathematics
and
mechanics
in
<year>
,
and
began
his
graduate
studies.
in
<year>
,
at
the
age
of
<integer>
years
,
he
became
a
full
professor.
later
,
kantorovich
worked
for
the
soviet
government.
he
was
given
the
task
of
optimizing
production
in
a
plywood
industry.
he
devised
the
mathematical
technique
now
known
as
linear
programming
in
<year>
,
some
years
before
it
was
advanced
by
george
dantzig.
he
authored
several
books
including
the
mathematical
method
of
production
planning
and
organization
(
russian
original
<year>
)
,
the
best
uses
of
economic
resources
(
russian
original
<year>
)
,
and
,
with
vladimir
ivanovich
krylov
,
approximate
methods
of
higher
analysis
(
russian
original
<year>
)
.
for
his
work
,
kantorovich
was
awarded
the
stalin
prize
in
<year>.
after
<year>
,
he
became
a
professor
at
military
engineering-technical
university.
during
the
siege
of
leningrad
,
kantorovich
was
a
professor
at
vitu
of
navy
and
worked
on
safety
of
the
road
of
life.
he
calculated
the
optimal
distance
between
cars
on
ice
in
dependence
of
the
thickness
of
ice
and
the
temperature
of
the
air.
in
december
<year>
and
january
<year>
,
kantorovich
walked
himself
between
cars
driving
on
the
ice
of
lake
ladoga
on
the
road
of
life
to
ensure
that
cars
did
not
sink.
however
,
many
cars
with
food
for
survivors
of
the
siege
were
destroyed
by
the
german
airstrikes.
in
<year>
kantorovich
was
assigned
to
the
atomic
project
of
the
ussr.
for
his
feat
and
courage
kantorovich
was
awarded
the
order
of
the
patriotic
war
,
and
was
decorated
with
the
medal
for
defense
of
leningrad.
after
<year>
,
kantorovich
lived
and
worked
in
novosibirsk
,
where
he
created
and
took
charge
of
the
department
of
computational
mathematics
in
novosibirsk
state
university.the
nobel
memorial
prize
,
which
he
shared
with
tjalling
koopmans
,
was
given
``
for

''
==
mathematics
==
in
mathematical
analysis
,
kantorovich
had
important
results
in
functional
analysis
,
approximation
theory
,
and
operator
theory.
in
particular
,
kantorovich
formulated
some
fundamental
results
in
the
theory
of
normed
vector
lattices
,
especially
in
dedekind
complete
vector
lattices
which
is
named
called
``
k-spaces
''
and
are
now
referred
to
as
``
kantorovich
spaces
''
in
his
honor.
kantorovich
showed
that
functional
analysis
could
be
used
in
the
analysis
of
iterative
methods
,
obtaining
the
kantorovich
inequalities
on
the
convergence
rate
of
the
gradient
method
and
of
newton
's
method
(
see
the
kantorovich
theorem
)
.
kantorovich
considered
infinite-dimensional
optimization
problems
,
such
as
the
kantorovich-monge
problem
in
transport
theory.
his
analysis
proposed
the
kantorovich
--
rubinstein
metric
,
which
is
used
in
probability
theory
,
in
the
theory
of
the
weak
convergence
of
probability
measures.

was
a
french-born
economist
and
mathematician.
best
known
as
a
professor
of
economics
at
the
university
of
california
,
berkeley
,
where

he
won
the

==
biography
==
his
father
was
the
business
partner
of
his
maternal
grandfather
in
lace
manufacturing
,
a
traditional
industry
in
calais.
debreu
was
orphaned
at
an
early
age
,
as
his
father
committed
suicide
and
his
mother
died
of
natural
causes.
prior
to
the
start
of
world
war
ii
,
he
received
his
baccalauréat
and
went
to
ambert
to
begin
preparing
for
the
entrance
examination
of
a
grande
école.
later
on
,
he
moved
from
ambert
to
grenoble
to
complete
his
preparation
,
both
places
being
in
vichy
france
during
world
war
ii.
in
<year>
,
he
was
admitted
to
the
école
normale
supérieure
in
paris
,
along
with
marcel
boiteux.
he
was
influenced
by
henri
cartan
and
the
bourbaki
writers.
when
he
was
about
to
take
the
final
examinations
in
<year>
,
the
normandy
landings
occurred
and
he
,
instead
,
enlisted
in
the
french
army.
he
was
transferred
for
training
to
algeria
and
then
served
in
the
occupying
french
forces
in
germany
until
july
<year>.
debreu
passed
the
agrégation
de
mathématiques
exams
at
the
end
of
<year>
and
the
beginning
of
<year>.
by
this
time
,
he
had
become
interested
in
economics
,
particularly
in
the
general
equilibrium
theory
of
léon
walras.
from
<year>
to
<year>
,
he
was
an
assistant
in
the
centre
national
de
la
recherche
scientifique.
during
these
two
and
a
half
years
,
he
made
the
transition
from
mathematics
to
economics.
in
<year>
,
debreu
went
to
the
united
states
on
a
rockefeller
fellowship
which
allowed
him
to
visit
several
american
universities
,
as
well
as
those
in
uppsala
and
oslo
in
<year>–<integer>.
debreu
married
françoise
bled
in
<year>
and
they
had
two
daughters
,
chantal
and
florence
,
born
in
<year>
and
<year>
respectively.
debreu
died
in
paris
at
the
age
of
<integer>
of
natural
causes
on
new
year
's
eve
,
<year>.
==
academic
career
==
debreu
began
working
as
a
research
associate
and
joined
the
cowles
commission
at
the
university
of
chicago
in
the
summer
of
<year>.
he
remained
there
for
five
years
,
returning
to
paris
periodically.
in
<year>
,
he
published
a
breakthrough
paper
,
entitled
existence
of
an
equilibrium
for
a
competitive
economy
,
together
with
kenneth
arrow
,
in
which
they
provided
a
definitive
mathematical
proof
of
the
existence
of
a
general
equilibrium
,
using
topological
rather
than
calculus-based
methods.
in
<year>
,
he
moved
to
yale
university.
in
<year>
,
he
published
his
classical
monograph
,
theory
of
value
:
an
axiomatic
analysis
of
economic
equilibrium
(
cowles
foundation
monographs
series
)
,
which
is
one
of
the
most
important
works
in
mathematical
economics.
he
also
studied
several
problems
in
the
theory
of
cardinal
utility
,
in
particular
the
additive
decomposition
of
a
utility
function
defined
on
a
cartesian
product
of
sets.
in
this
monograph
,
debreu
set
up
an
axiomatic
foundation
for
competitive
markets.
he
also
established
the
existence
of
an
equilibrium
using
a
novel
approach.
the
main
idea
of
his
argument
is
to
show
that
there
exists
a
price
system
for
which
the
aggregate
excess
demand
correspondence
vanishes.
he
did
so
by
proving
a
type
of
fixed-point
theorem
that
is
based
on
the
kakutani
fixed-point
theorem.
in
chapter
<integer>
,
debreu
introduced
the
concept
of
uncertainty
and
showed
how
it
could
be
incorporated
into
the
deterministic
model.
here
,
he
introduced
the
notion
of
a
contingent
commodity
,
which
is
a
promise
to
deliver
a
good
should
a
certain
state
of
nature
be
realized.
this
concept
is
very
frequently
used
in
financial
economics
,
where
it
is
known
as
the
``
arrow–debreu
security
''
.
in
<year>–<integer>
,
he
worked
at
the
center
for
advanced
study
in
the
behavioral
sciences
at
stanford
and
devoted
most
of
his
time
to
the
complex
proof
that
appeared
in
<year>
of
a
general
theorem
on
the
existence
of
an
economic
equilibrium.
in
january
<year>
,
he
started
working
at
the
university
of
california
,
berkeley
,
where
he
held
the
titles
of
university
professor
and
class
of
<year>
professor
of
economics
and
mathematics
emeritus.
during
his
sabbaticals
in
the
late
<year>s
and
<year>s
,
he
visited
universities
in
leiden
,
cambridge
,
bonn
and
paris.
in
<year>
,
he
visited
the
university
of
canterbury
as
an
erskine
fellow
,
lecturing
in
economic
theory.his
later
studies
centred
mainly
on
the
theory
of
differentiable
economies
,
where
he
showed
that
,
in
general
,
aggregate
excess
demand
functions
vanish
at
a
finite
number
of
points
–
basically
,
he
showed
that
economies
have
a
finite
number
of
price
equilibria.
in
<year>
,
he
received
the
french
legion
of
honour.
he
was
awarded
the
<year>
bank
of
sweden
prize
in
economic
sciences
in
memory
of
alfred
nobel
,
for
having
incorporated
new
analytical
methods
into
economic
theory
and
for
his
rigorous
reformulation
of
general
equilibrium
theory.
he
was
a
member
of
the
international
academy
of
science.
in
<year>
,
he
served
as
president
of

due

her

mandl
as
an

controlling
husband
who
strongly
objected
to
her
simulated
orgasm
scene
in
ecstasy

prevented
her
from
pursuing
her

she
claimed
she
was
kept
a

mandl
had

had
ties
to

as

lamarr
wrote
that
the
dictators
of
both
countries
attended
lavish
parties
at

mandl
home.
lamarr
accompanied
mandl
to
business
meetings
,
where
he
conferred
with
scientists

other
professionals
involved
in

technology.
these
conferences
were
her
introduction

nurtured
her
latent
talent
in
science.lamarr
's
marriage
to
mandl
eventually
became
unbearable

and
she
decided
to
separate
herself
from

wrote
that

disguised
herself

fled

by

accounts
,
she
persuaded
mandl
to
let
her
wear
all
of
her
jewelry
for
a
dinner
party
,
then
disappeared
afterward.
she
writes
about
her
marriage
:
i
knew
very
soon
that
i
could
never
be
an
actress
while
i
was
his
wife.
...
he
was
the
absolute
monarch
in

i
was
like

had
to

guarded—and
imprisoned—having

shunned

wondered
why

howard
sharpe
interviewed
her

gave
his
impression
:
hedy
has
the
most
incredible
personal
sophistication.
she
knows
the
peculiarly
european
art
of
being
womanly
;
she
knows
what
men
want
in

woman
,
what
attracts
them
,
and
she
forces
herself
to
be
these
things.
she
has
magnetism
with
warmth
,
something
that
neither
dietrich
nor
garbo
has
managed
to
achieve.
author
richard
rhodes
describes
her
assimilation
into
american
culture
:
of
all
the
european
émigrés
who
escaped
nazi
germany

nazi
austria
,
she
was
one
of
the
very
few
who
succeeded
in
moving
to
another
culture
and
becoming
a
full-fledged
star
herself.
there
were
so
very
few
who
could
make
the
transition
linguistically
or
culturally.
she
really
was
a
resourceful
human
being–i
think
because
of
her
father
's
strong
influence
on
her
as
a
child.
lamarr
also

penchant
for
speaking

rhodes
was

the

==
inventor
==
although
lamarr
had
no
formal
training
and
was
primarily
self-taught
,
she
worked
in
her
spare
time
on
various
hobbies
and
inventions
,
which
included
an
improved
traffic
stoplight
and
a
tablet
that
would
dissolve
in
water
to
create
a
carbonated
drink.
the
beverage
was
unsuccessful
;
lamarr
herself
said
it
tasted
like
alka-seltzer.
among
the
few
who
knew
of
lamarr
's
inventiveness
was
aviation
tycoon
howard
hughes.
she
suggested
he
change
the
rather
square
design
of
his
aeroplanes
(
which
she
thought
looked
too
slow
)
to
a
more
streamlined
shape
,
based
on
pictures
of
the
fastest
birds
and
fish
she
could
find.
lamarr
discussed
her
relationship
with
hughes
during
an
interview
,
saying
that
while
they
dated
,
he
actively
supported
her
``
tinkering
''
hobbies.
he
put
his
team
of
scientists
and
engineers
at
her
disposal
,
saying
they
would
do
or
make
anything
she
asked
for.during
world
war
ii
,
lamarr
learned
that
radio-controlled
torpedoes
,
an
emerging
technology
in
naval
war
,
could
easily
be
jammed
and
set
off
course.
she
thought
of
creating
a
frequency-hopping
signal
that
could
not
be
tracked
or
jammed.
she
contacted
her
friend
,
composer
and
pianist
george
antheil
,
to
help
her
develop
a
device
for
doing
that
,
and
he
succeeded
by
synchronizing
a
miniaturized
player-piano
mechanism
with
radio
signals.
they
drafted
designs
for
the
frequency-hopping
system
,
which
they
patented.
antheil
recalled
:
we
began
talking
about
the
war
,
which
,
in
the
late
summer
of

,
was
looking
most
extremely
black.
hedy
said
that
she
did
not
feel
very
comfortable
,
sitting
there
in
hollywood
and
making
lots
of
money
when
things
were
in
such
a
state.
she
said
that
she
knew
a
good
deal
about
munitions
and
various
secret
weapons
...
and
that
she
was
thinking
seriously
of
quitting
mgm
and
going
to
washington
,
dc
,
to
offer
her
services
to
the

===
interactional
view
===
watzlawick
did
extensive
research
on
how
communication
is
effected
within
families.
watzlawick
defines
five
basic
axioms
in
his
theory
on
communication
,
popularly
known
as
the
``
interactional
view
''
.
the
interactional
view
is
an
interpretive
theory
drawing
from
the
cybernetic
tradition.
the
five
axioms
are
necessary
in
order
to
have
a
functioning
communication
process
and
competence
between
two
individuals
or
an
entire
family.
when
it
comes
to
this
theory
,
miscommunication
happens
because
all
of
the
communicators
are
not
``
speaking
the
same
language
''
.
this
happens
because
people
have
different
viewpoints
of
speaking.
its
principles
are
cybernetic
,
its
causality
is
of
a
circular
,
feedback
nature
,
and
,
with
information
being
its
core
element
,
it
is
concerned
with
the
processes
of
communication
within
systems
of
the
widest
sense—and
therefore
also
with
human
systems
,
e.g.
,
families
,
large
organizations
and
even
international
relations.
the
communication
within
the
``
interactional
view
''
is
based
on
what
is
happening
,
and
not
necessarily
associated
with
who
,
when
,
where
,
or
why
it
takes
place.
``
normal
''
as
well
as
the
``
disturbed
''
family
is
studied
in
order
to
infer
conditions
conducive
to
the
approach
of
interaction-orientation.
it
is
believed
that
individual
personality
,
character
,
and
deviance
are
shaped
by
the
individual
's
relations
with
his
fellows.
thus
,
symptoms
,
defenses
,
character
structure
and
personality
can
be
seen
as
terms
describing
the
individual
's
typical
interactions
which
occur
in
response
to
a
particular
interpersonal
context.
the
whole
is
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
,
and
it
is
that
whole
in
which
we
are
interested.
===
five
basic
axioms
===
the
interactional
view
requires
a
network
of
communication
rules
that
govern
a
family
homeostasis
,
which
is
the
tacit
collusion
of
family
members
to
maintain
the
status
quo.
even
if
the
status
quo
is
negative
it
can
still
be
hard
to
change.
interactional
theorists
believe
that
we
will
fail
to
recognize
this
destructive
resistance
to
change
unless
we
understand
watzlawick
's
axioms.
the
following
axioms
can
explain
how
miscommunication
can
occur
if
all
the
communicators
are
not
on
the
same
page.
if
one
of
these
axioms
is
somehow
disturbed
,
communication
might
fail.
all
of
these
axioms
are
derived
from
the
work
of
gregory
bateson
,
much
of
which
is
collected
in
steps
to
an
ecology
of
mind
(
<year>
)
.watzlawick
,
beavin
bavelas
and
jackson
support
these
axioms
to
maintain
family
homeostasis.
one
can
not
not
communicate
:
every
behavior
is
a
form
of
communication.
because
behavior
does
not
have
a
counterpart
(
there
is
no
anti-behavior
)
,
it
is
impossible
not
to
communicate.
even
if
communication
is
being
avoided
(
such
as
the
unconscious
use
of
non-verbals
or
symptom
strategy
)
,
that
is
a
form
of
communication.
``
symptom
strategy
''
is
ascribing
our
silence
to
something
beyond
our
control
and
makes
no
communication
impossible.
examples
of
symptom
strategy
are
sleepiness
,
headaches
,
and
drunkenness.
even
facial
expressions
,
digital
communication
,
and
being
silent
can
be
analyzed
as
communication
by
a
receiver.
every
communication
has
a
content
and
relationship
aspect
such
that
the
latter
classifies
the
former
and
is
therefore
a
metacommunication
:
all
communication
includes
,
apart
from
the
plain
meaning
of
words
,
more
information.
this
information
is
based
on
how
the
speaker
wants
to
be
understood
and
how
he
himself
sees
his
relation
to
the
receiver
of
information.
relationship
is
the
command
part
of
the
message
or
how
it
is
non-verbally
said.
content
is
the
report
or
what
is
said
verbally.
being
able
to
interpret
both
of
these
aspects
is
essential
in
understanding
something
that
a
communicator
said.
the
relational
aspect
of
interaction
is
known
as
metacommunication.
metacommunication
is
communication
about
communication.
relationship
messages
are
always
the
most
important
element
in
communication.
the
nature
of
a
relationship
is
dependent
on
the
punctuation
of
the
partners
'
communication
procedures
:
both
the
sender
and
the
receiver
of
information
structure
the
communication
flow
differently
and
therefore
interpret
their
own
behavior
during
communicating
as
merely
a
reaction
on
the
other
's
behavior
(
i.e.
,
every
partner
thinks
the
other
one
is
the
cause
of
a
specific
behavior
)
.
to
punctuate
a
communication
means
to
interpret
an
ongoing
sequence
of
events
by
labeling
one
event
as
the
cause
and
the
following
event
as
the
response.
in
a
situation
with
communication
,
if
one
thing
happens
,
something
else
always
happens.
for
example
,
a
female
in
a
relationship
with
a
male
is
feeling
depressed.
the
male
in
the
relationship
with
the
female
feels
guilty.
one
who
observes
this
situation
might
ask
,
``
is
she
depressed
because
of
his
guilt
,
or
does
he
feel
guilty
because
of
her
depression
?
''
human
communication
involves
both
digital
and
analog
modalities
:
this
axiom
refers
back
to
the
use
of
non-verbals
and
system
strategy
explained
in
the
first
axiom.
it
is
mostly
related
to
the
digital
content
of
communication
within
a
relationship.
inter-human
communication
procedures
are
either
symmetric
or
complementary
:
this
axiom
focuses
on
metacommunication
with
two
main
components
called
symmetrical
interchange
and
complementary
interchange.
symmetrical
interchange
is
an
interaction
based
on
equal
power
between
communicators.
in
accordance
to
that
,
complementary
interchange
is
an
interaction
based
on
differences
in
power.
within
these
two
interchanges
there
are
three
different
ways
they
can
be
used
:
one-up
,
one-down
,
and
one-across.
with
a
one-up
communication
,
one
communicator
attempts
to
gain
control
of
an
exchange
by
dominating
the
overall
communication.
a
one-down
communication
has
the
opposite
effect.
a
communicator
attempts
to
yield
control
of
an
interaction
or
submit
to
someone.
the
final
message
is
a
one-across
communication.
this
communication
moves
to
neutralize
a
situation.
this
is
also
called
transitory
if
only
one
communicator
is
attempting
this
style.
when
two
communicators
use
the
same
style
of
one-up
,
one-down
,
or
one-across
,
it
is
symmetrical.
if
they
are
opposing
one
another
it
is
complementary.
this
axiom
allows
us
to
understand
how
an
interaction
can
be
perceived
by
the
styles
a
communicator
is
using.
===
additional
notions
===
some
interrelated
notions
that
make
up
the
interactional
view
promoted
by
watzlawick
and
colleagues
at
the
mri
include
:
one
can
not
not
communicate
,
and
the
related
idea
that
one
can
not
not
influence
;
understanding
behavior
as
if
we
are
constantly
exchanging
messages
defining
the
nature
of
relationships
of
which
we
are
a
part
;
shifting
focus
of
attention
from
intent
to
the
effects
of
behavior
as
communication
;
observer-imposed
punctuation
;
emphasizing
the
vital
role
of
the
therapist
's
preconceptions
in
bringing
forth
socially
constructed
reality
;
investing
the
ramifications
of
self-fulfilling
prophecy
;
and
articulating
and
fully
embracing
the
``
as
if
''
nature
of
behavior.a
term
that
is
used
often
in
the
theory
of
the
interactional
view
is
enabler.
an
enabler
is
within
addiction
culture
;
a
person
whose
non-assertive
behavior
allows
others
to
continue
in
their
substance
abuse.
an
example
of
this
would
be
a
person
letting
their
sibling
continue
to
act
in
an
immature
manner
because
that
is
what
the
family
is
used
to
him
doing.
another
word
frequently
used
in
the
interactional
view
is
double-bind.
someone
in
a
double-bind
,
is
a
person
trapped
by
expectations
;
the
powerful
party
requests
that
the
low-power
party
act
symmetrically.
an
example
of
this
would
be
a
person
asking
another
person
,
``
why
did
n't
you
like
the
movie
?
''
or
``
you
like
rock
'n
'
roll
,
do
n't
you
?
''
the
first
person
is
asking
the
second
person
to
act
in
a
way
that
is
similar
(
symmetrical
)
to
them.
===
criticisms
===
the
critique
of
this
theory
can
be
centered
on
one
main
thing
:
the
application
of
the
theory
as
a
whole.
being
able
to
take
these
axioms
and
apply
them
to
relationships
between
families
can
be
very
difficult
to
master.
it
can
be
said
that
this
theory
is
trapped
because
it
is
so
hard
to
apply.
also
,
the
theory
itself
does
not
claim
and
exact
applications
other
than
``
reframing
''
.
reframing
asks
the
communicators
to
step
outside
of
the
situation
and
reinterpret
what
it
means.
this
can
be
hard
because
the
theory
states
that
only
an
outside
source
can
see
a
problem
because
people
are
``
speaking
their
own
language
''
.
this
theory
also
shows
how
a
relationship
has
already
changed
,
but
it
does
not
give
practical
ways
to
go
about
changing
it.
this
system
resists
change
and
it
can
be
hard
to
actively
use
the
five
axioms.
related
to
the
first
axiom
,
non-verbal
communication
can
be
viewed
as
informative
rather
than
communicative.
with
the
behavioral
characteristic
of
equifinality
involved
,
it
is
hard
to
know
when
the
system
of
the
interactional
view
is
happening
or
not.
equifinality
is
the
systems
theory
assumption
that
a
given
outcome
could
have
occurred
due
to
any
or
many
interconnected
factors
rather
than
being
a
result
in
a
cause—effect
relationship.
this
theory
rests
on
the
word
communication
,
but
this
word
can
be
interpreted
very
differently
between
people.
the
definitions
of
communication
can
be
very
controversial.
overall
,
the
axioms
do
a
great
job
of
explaining
problems
,
but
do
not
provide
solutions
to
the
problems
they
bring
up.
this
critique
does
fail
however
to
acknowledge
watzlawick
's
influence
on
the
development
of
brief
therapy
,
a
hugely
important
and
influential
school
of
psychotherapy
which
is
only
too
practical
and
usable
in
helping
people
make
changes.

church
osborne
professor
of
public
affairs
emeritus
and
professor
of
economics
emeritus
at
princeton
university
,
coale
was
a
prolific
author
,
publishing
more
than
<integer>
books
and
articles
on
a
wide
variety
of
demographic
topics.
his
growth
and
structure
of
human
populations
(
<year>
)
is
considered
an
essential
textbook
for
those
interested
in
formal
demography.
he
also
trained
and
served
as
a
mentor
to
many
students
who
would
become
leaders
in
the
field.
coale
joined
the
faculty
at
princeton
in
<year>
,
the
same
year
he
received
his
ph.d.
at
the
same
site.
he
spent
his
entire
academic
career
at
the
university
's
office
of
population
research
,
serving
as
director
from
<year>
to
<year>.
he
was
president
of
the
population
association
of
america
in
<year>–<integer>
and
president
of
the
international
union
for
the
scientific
study
of
population
(
iussp
)
from
<year>
to
<year>.coale
's
first
major
influential
work
was
population
growth
and
economic
development
in
low-income
countries
(
<year>
)
,
which
he
co-wrote
with
edgar
hoover.
the
results
,
which
showed
that
slowing
population
growth
could
enhance
economic
development
,
had
a
major
impact
on
public
policy
and
set
the
research
agenda
in
this
field.
this
study
was
followed
by
regional
model
life
tables
and
stable
populations
(
<year>
)
,
which
he
co-wrote
with
paul
demeny.
these
model
life
tables
both
established
new
empirical
regularities
and
proved
invaluable
in
the
development
of
later
techniques
for
estimating
mortality
and
fertility
in
populations
with
inaccurate
or
incomplete
data.
along
with
william
brass
,
coale
pioneered
the
development
and
use
of
these
techniques
,
first
explained
in
methods
of
estimating
basic
demographic
measures
from
incomplete
data
(
<year>
,
with
demeny
)
and
in
the
demography
of
tropical
africa
(
<year>
,
with
other
demographers
)
.
perhaps
coale
's
most
major
scientific
contribution
was
to
the
understanding
of
the
demographic
transition.
the
demographic
transition
,
as
stated
by
coale
,
occurs
when
a
country
develops
a
strong
economy
,
and
within
the
society
,
low
fertility
and
mortality
will
start
to
reflect
based
upon
the
economic
standpoint.
coale
was
the
pioneer
of
the
european
fertility
project
,
which
examined
the
decline
in
marital
fertility
in
europe.
the
european
fertility
project
's
goal
was
to
correlate
the
fertility
rates
within
married
couples
with
the
rate
of
infant
mortality.
coale
established
three
pre-conditions
to
fertility
decline.
the
first
is
``
within
the
conscious
of
choice.
''
in
other
words
,
it
is
up
to
the
individual
and
within
their
own
decision
whether
or
not
to
have
children.
the
second
is
that
if
a
society
sees
not
having
children
as
advantageous
,
then
fertility
will
decline.
the
third
pre-condition
is
to
have
contraception
methods
ready.
it
is
important
to
emphasize
that
a
society
will
start
to
show
signs
of
fertility
decline
if
these
three
pre-conditions
are
met.initiated
in
<year>
,
the
project
resulted
in
the
publication
of
nine
major
books
summarizing
the
change
in
childbearing
over
a
century
in
the
<integer>
provinces
in
europe.
the
project
findings
eventually
led
to
the
conclusion
that
even
though
economical
factors
can
play
a
role
in
fertility
decline
,
this
is
not
the
absolute
determinant
of
fertility
decline.
the
european
fertility
project
led
to
a
better
understanding
that
infant
mortality
and
fertility
decline
do
not
necessarily
follow
each
other.
with
a
long-time
interest
in
the
population
of
russia
,
which
first
found
outlet
in
coale
's
work
on
the
life
tables
that
he
constructed
for
frank
lorimer
's
classic
the
population
of
the
soviet
union
(
<year>
)
,
coale
also
later
co-authored
a
volume
on
russia
for
the
european
fertility
project
series.toward
the
end
of
his
career
,
coale
became
interested
in
the
population
changes
in
china
and
understanding
the
fertility
transition
there
as
well
as
factors
affecting
the
sex
ratio
at
birth.
in
a
<year>
study
he
conducted
,
india
and
china
were
compared
in
both
their
population
size
and
fertility
trends.
a
survey
named
the
``
<integer>/<integer>
fertility
survey
''
reached
out
to
women
living
in
various
provinces
of
china
and
asked
them
to
relate
a
brief
history
of
their
marital
status
and
a
family
planning
discussion.
the
survey
contributed
to
an
understanding
of
the
population
and
fertility
changes
that
would
occur
in
china
shortly
after.
published
in
a
journal
article
called
population
trends
in
china
and
india
,
coale
introduced
the
possible
causes
of
differences
in
fertility
trends
in
such
highly
populated
countries.
these
reasons
are
based
on
policies
put
in
place
to
reduce
birth
rates
as
well
as
some
cultural
differences
that
come
into
play.
finally
,
coale
presents
the
future
of
both
countries
and
states
that
despite
the
efforts
to
reduce
birth
rates
,
the
countries
will
remain
the
most
populated.

meetings
,
as
well
as

(
in

,
again
with

)
.
to
commemorate
the
<integer>th
anniversary
of
his
birthday
,
the
swiss
national
bank
started
the
karl
brunner
distinguished
lecture
series
in
<year>.
the
first
lecture
was
given
by
kenneth
rogoff
in
zurich.
==
monetarism
==
karl
brunner
introduced
in
<year>
the
term
monetarism
into
the
mainstream
vocabulary
of
economics.
fundamentally
,
brunner
conceived
monetarism
as
the
application
of
relative-price
theory
to
the
analysis
of
aggregate
phenomena.
in
his
interview
with
arjo
klamer
,
he
notably
claimed
that
:
“the
basic
tenet
of
monetarism
is
the
reassertion
of
the
relevance
of
price
theory
to
understand
what
happens
in
aggregate
economics.
our
fundamental
point
is
that
price
theory
is
a
crucial
paradigm
–
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
the
only
paradigm
–
that
economists
have”
(
klamer
<year>
,
p.
<integer>
)
.
this
particular
conception
of
monetarism
seems
closely
related
to
brunner’s
experience
at
ucla
:
“most
distressing
was
moreover
the
encounter
with
a
group
of
economists
systematically
applying
economic
analysis
(
i.e.
price
theory
)
to
social
problems
of
our
world.
the
resulting
confusions
yielded
a
fertile
ground
for
the
right
environment
,
and
ucla
at
the
beginning
of
the
<year>s
was
for
me
the
right
place.
the
permanent
discussion
with
a
subtle
mind
(
armen
a.
alchian
)
,
the
impact
of
a
lucid
philosopher
of
science
(
reichenbach
)
,
and
the
good
fortune
of
questioning
and
determined
students
(
allan
h.
meltzer
,
tibor
fabian
,
later
on
jerry
jordan
and
others
)
dispersed
the
intellectual
fogs
and
gradually
structured
my
thinking
about
economics
and
its
role
in
our
endeavour
to
understand
the
world”
(
brunner
<year>
,
p.
<integer>
)
.
similarly
,
to
the
question
“when
did
you
become
a
monetarist
?
”
,
brunner
answered
:
“i
find
it
actually
quite
interesting
in
retrospect
to
retrace
the
question
in
my
discussions
with
alchian”
(
klamer
<year>
,
p.
<integer>
)
.
more
specifically
,
brunner
considered
that
“the
major
propositions
characterizing
the
monetarist
view
can
be
organized
into
four
groups.
these
groups
bear
on
descriptions
of
the
transmission
mechanism
,
the
dynamic
properties
of
the
private
sector
,
the
dominance
and
nature
of
the
monetary
impulses
and
the
separation
of
aggregate
and
allocative
forces”
(
brunner
<year>
,
p.
<integer>
)
.
==
the
transmission
of
monetary
policy
==
in
the
above
quotation
,
as
well
as
in
other
accounts
of
the
main
propositions
characterizing
monetarism
,
karl
brunner
systematically
mentioned
the
transmission
mechanism
of
monetary
policy
first.
according
to
brunner
and
allan
meltzer
(
<year>
)
,
a
monetarist
transmission
mechanism
is
such
that
“changes
in
money
modify
relative
prices
and
initiate
a
process
of
substitution
that
spreads
to
the
markets
for
existing
capital
securities
,
loans
and
current
output”
(
p.
<integer>
)
.
the
central
role
played
by
relative-price
movements
led
brunner
to
use
the
terms
'transmission
process
'
and
'relative-price
process
'
interchangeably.
he
actually
perceived
the
transmission
mechanism
as
“a
suitable
application
of
relative
price
theory”
to
explain
output
and
employment
fluctuations
(
brunner
<year>
,
p.
<integer>
)
.
more
precisely
,
the
transmission
mechanism
of
monetary
policy
considered
by
brunner
and
meltzer
relies
on
the
relative
behavior
of
two
prices.
first
,
the
price
of
existing
real
assets
,
denoted
by
p
,
which
is
actually
the
price
of
existing
real
capital.
second
,
the
price
of
output
,
denoted
by
p
,
which
is
the
price
of
the
item
used
both
for
building
new
real
capital
and
for
consumption
purposes.
moreover
,
brunner
and
meltzer
assumed
that
the
costs
of
acquiring
information
are
smaller
in
the
assets
markets
than
in
the
output
market.
as
a
result
,
the
speed
of
adjustment
of
p
in
response
to
shocks
is
higher
than
that
of
p.
an
increase
in
the
growth
rate
of
money
supply
thus
implies
a
rise
in
the
ratio
of
p
to
p.
this
means
that
the
price
of
new
capital
has
fallen
relative
to
the
price
of
existing
capital
,
stimulating
private
investment
(
i.e.
the
production
of
new
capital
)
.
furthermore
,
a
rise
in
the
p
to
p
ratio
also
generates
a
positive
wealth
effect
and
then
an
increase
in
private
consumption.
hence
,
an
expansionary
monetary
policy
raises
each
component
of
private
aggregate
spending
through
an
increase
in
p/p.
it
is
worth
noting
that
this
mechanism
is
close
to
the
one
set
out
by
james
tobin
(
the
so-called
tobin’s
q
)
in
<year>.
==
the
origin
of
money
==
in
<year>
,
karl
brunner
and
allan
meltzer
delivered
an
analysis
of
the
origin
of
money
as
a
medium
of
exchange.
the
essentials
of
the
explanation
presented
there
were
first
set
out
in
a
paper
published
in
<year>
in
the
journal
of
finance
(
brunner
and
meltzer
<year>
,
p.
<integer><integer>
)
.
the
crucial
ingredient
is
the
absence
of
perfect
information
about
the
quality
of
the
goods
households
seek
to
purchase.
searching
for
information
about
the
quality
of
goods
involves
some
costs
,
whose
amount
differs
substantially
across
goods.
in
this
context
,
the
goods
with
comparatively
lower
information
costs
for
most
households
will
emerge
as
media
of
exchange
:
“where
knowledge
of
market
opportunities
and
the
qualities
of
goods
is
neither
costless
to
obtain
nor
uniformly
distributed
,
the
use
of
money
as
a
medium
of
exchange
reduces
the
resource
cost
of
exchanging
...
for
individuals
,
money
is
a
substitute
for
investment
in
information
and
labor
allocated
to
search.
by
using
money
,
individuals
reduce
the
amount
of
information
they
must
acquire
,
process
,
and
store
,
and
they
reduce
the
number
of
transactions
in
which
they
engage
to
exchange
their
initial
endowments
for
optimal
baskets
of
goods”
(
brunner
and
meltzer
<year>
,
p.
<integer>
)
.
==
monetary
policy
and
the
defense
of
money
growth
rules
==
in
the
<year>s
,
karl
brunner
(
largely
agreeing
with
milton
friedman
)
considered
that
the
then-popular
literature
on
optimal
policy
,
in
which
“the
policy
maker
is
given
complete
knowledge
of
the
structural
relations
pertaining
to
the
economy
and
a
set
of
goal
variables
that
enter
the
social
utility
function”
(
brunner
and
meltzer
<year>
,
p.
<integer>
)
,
missed
the
essential
point
of
the
real-world
policy
problem.
in
collaboration
with
allan
meltzer
,
brunner
proposed
an
analytic
framework
labelled
“targets
and
indicators
of
monetary
policy”
,
in
which
monetary
policy
could
usefully
be
discussed
and
criticized.
in
the
words
of
brunner
and
meltzer
(
<year>
)
,
“the
problem
of
selecting
an
indicator
of
monetary
policy
is
equivalent
to
the
problem
of
finding
a
scale
that
allows
us
to
make
reliable
statements
comparing
the
thrust
of
various
policy
combinations”
(
p.
<integer>
)
.
under
conditions
of
complete
knowledge
,
the
indicator
problem
is
totally
trivial.
in
this
case
,
indeed
,
the
thrust
of
any
policy
combination
on
any
variable
can
always
be
calculated
with
utter
accuracy.
under
uncertainty
,
however
,
things
are
different.
for
example
,
brunner
and
meltzer
showed
that
,
within
their
framework
,
the
behavior
of
free
reserves
(
a
widely
deployed
guide
to
the
stance
of
monetary
policy
in
the
<year>s
)
was
not
monotonically
related
to
the
tightness
or
looseness
of
policy
conceived
of
in
such
terms.
therefore
,
to
rely
upon
it
was
to
run
the
risk
of
misconstruing
policy
's
stance
,
perhaps
rendering
it
pro-cyclical
and
destabilizing.
karl
brunner
later
defended
money
growth
rules
of
the
type
proposed
by
milton
friedman.
he
became
convinced
that
,
though
discretionary
policy
did
sometimes
deliver
“phases
of
remarkably
stability
and
growth
...
such
phases
depend
essentially
on
transitory
political
constellations”
(
<year>
,
p.
<integer>
)
.
thus
“the
nature
of
the
monetary
order
and
not
the
specific
actions
within
a
discretionary
regime
emerged
in
recent
years
as
the
central
issue
of
a
more
fundamental
policy
problem”
(
p.
<integer>
)
.
as
a
result
,
there
is
a
clear
“advantage
of
a
monetary
order
based
on
a
constant
monetary
growth”
(
p.
<integer>
)
.
==
the
criticism
of
walrasian
economics
==
a
short
time
before
passing
away
,
karl
brunner
defined
monetarism
as
a
“
'classical
'
programme
of
a
non-walrasian
tradition”
(
brunner
<year>
,
p.
<integer>
)
.
walrasian
economics
would
notably
be
unable
to
account
for
the
emergence
of
many
institutions
,
and
especially
money
:
“the
walrasian
paradigm
,
based
on
the
absence
of
information
and
transaction
costs
,
necessarily
omits
all
social
phenomena
conditioned
by
the
operation
of
such
costs.
with
full
information
and
in
the
absence
of
any
transaction
costs
there
is
no
reason
for
the
occurrence
of
money
,
on
financial
intermediaries
and
no
rationale
for
many
other
social
institutions
...
important
problems
of
our
monetary
and
financial
reality
remain
inaccessible
to
such
a
walrasian
tradition”
(
p.
<integer>
)
.
among
neo-walrasian
economists
,
karl
brunner
focused
attention
on
the
authors
of
new
classical
macroeconomics
(
nmc
)
.
a
first
criticism
directed
towards
ncm
relates
to
the
rational
expectations
hypothesis.
under
this
hypothesis
,
“people
are
assumed
to
know
the
policy
rule
used
by
the
monetary
(
and
fiscal
)
authorities
and
to
have
detailed
knowledge
about
the
structure
of
the
economy
including
the
size
and
timing
of
responses
to
shocks
of
various
kinds.
these
assumptions
make
the
models
analytically
tractable
but
,
taken
literally
(
as
they
often
are
)
,
they
distort
the
economist
's
view
of
the
policy
problem
by
ignoring
uncertainty
,
incomplete
knowledge
about
the
structure
of
the
economy
and
the
costs
of
acquiring
information
and
reducing
uncertainty”
(
brunner
and
meltzer
<year>
,
p.
<integer>
)
.
a
second
criticism
addressed
by
brunner
to
ncm
concerns
the
intertemporal
concept
of
equilibrium
:
“i
also
have
strong
reservations
about
crucial
aspects
of
their
'equilibrium
approach
'
”
(
klamer
<year>
,
p.
<integer>
)
.
to
the
question
“so
what
is
wrong
with
new
classical
economics
?
”
,
brunner
answered
:
“their
interpretation
of
equilibrium
analysis
seems
dubious
to
me.
this
specific
kind
of
equilibrium
analysis
implies
that
all
prices
are
market-clearing
relative
to
all
shock-realizations”
(
p.
<integer>
)
.
as
a
result
,
ncm
can
not
explain
“the
lamented
unresponsiveness
of
prices
to
current
conditions”
(
brunner
<year>
,
p.
<integer>
)
,
i.e.
price
stickiness.
==
philosophy
of
science
and
evolutionary
perspective
==
looking
back
on
his
career
,
karl
brunner
considered
that
he
had
paid
attention
to
“three
distinct
major
groups
of
problems.
one
covers
the
range
of
monetary
analysis
and
policy
and
a
second
involves
the
nature
of
our
cognitive
endeavors
expressed
by
our
pursuits.
the
last
strand
of
my
persistent
interests
developed
over
time
from
my
occupation
with
the
previous
two
problems.
there
evolved
a
gradual
understanding
that
economic
analysis
offers
a
systematic
approach
to
the
whole
range
of
sociopolitical
reality”
(
brunner
<year>
,
p.
<integer>
)
.
this
section
deals
with
the
second
and
third
groups.
in
a
paper
entitled
“assumptions
and
the
cognitive
quality
of
theorie”
,
karl
brunner
argued
that
milton
friedman
(
in
his
famous
“methodology
of
positive
economics”
)
had
been
right
that
“the
cognitive
quality
of
a
theory
can
not
be
judged
by
the
realism
of
'assumptions
'
but
must
be
judged
by
the
confrontation
of
its
implications
with
suitable
observations”
(
brunner
<year>
,
p.
<integer>
)
.
brunner
further
stressed
the
impossibility
of
ever
obtaining
definitive
confirmation
of
any
general
theory
from
a
finite
array
of
empirical
evidence.
rather
,
and
like
karl
popper
(
<year>
)
,
he
pointed
out
the
capacity
of
such
evidence
to
falsify
theories.
at
the
same
time
,
“it
is
,
however
,
important
to
emphasise
that
actual
refutation
by
a
falsifying
test
statement
is
a
necessary
but
far
from
sufficient
reason
to
reject
a
theory.
our
choice
is
frequently
between
quite
imperfect
theories
,
i.e.
,
theories
which
had
(
sic
)
been
ex
posed
to
some
falsifying
test-statements.
the
comparative
extent
of
falsification
shapes
the
decision
and
not
falsification
as
such”
(
p.
<integer>
)
.
karl
brunner
also
developed
an
evolutionary
approach
of
the
economic
agent
(
notably
inspired
by
the
seminal
paper
of
armen
alchian
(
<year>
)
)
.
in
association
with
william
meckling
,
brunner
introduced
the
acronym
remm
,
for
'resourceful
,
evaluating
,
maximizing
man'.
according
to
brunner
(
<year>
)
,
“resourcefulness
,
evaluating
and
maximizing
behavior
possess
a
common
basis
...
(
for
which
)
the
individual
is
born
with
a
biological
and
genetic
heritage”
(
p.
<integer>
)
.
however
,
the
term
'maximizing
'
should
not
be
understood
in
the
usual
sense
of
the
neoclassical
theory.
indeed
,
“rationality
is
perhaps
a
more
basic
component
of
the
hypothesis
than
maximizing
behavior.
limited
computational
facilities
of
computers
and
human
minds
,
the
cost
of
gathering
and
interpreting
information
,
and
often
a
diffuse
uncertainty
prevent
the
expression
of
rational
behavior
in
terms
of
straightforward
maximization.
rational
behavior
produces
instead
a
set
of
more
or
less
conscious
rules
of
procedure”
(
p.
<integer>
)
.
this
remm
can
be
contrasted
with
alternative
“conceptions
of
man”
,
namely
the
“political”
,
“sociological”
,
and
“psychological”
ones.
brunner
and
meckling
(
<year>
)
notably
applied
this
approach
to
the
analysis
of
the
government
:
“much
of
the
conflict
about
government
can
...
be
reduced
to
the
conflict
between
alternative
models
of
man”

p.
<integer>
)

,
a
neoclassical
school
of
economic
thought
associated
with
the
work
of
the
faculty
at
the
university
of
chicago
that
rejected
keynesianism
in
favor
of
monetarism
until
the
mid-<year>s
,
when
it
turned
to
new
classical
macroeconomics
heavily
based
on
the
concept
of
rational
expectations.
several
students
,
young
professors
and
academics
who
were
recruited
or
mentored
by
friedman
at
chicago
went
on
to
become
leading
economists
,
including
gary
becker
,
robert
fogel
,
thomas
sowell
and
robert
lucas
jr.friedman
's
challenges
to
what
he
later
called
``
naive
keynesian
theory
''
began
with
his
interpretation
of
consumption
,
which
tracks
how
consumers
spend.
he
introduced
a
theory
which
would
later
become
part
of
the
mainstream
and
among
the
first
to
propagate
the
theory
of
consumption
smoothing.
during
the
<year>s
he
became
the
main
advocate
opposing
keynesian
government
policies
,
and
described
his
approach
(
along
with
mainstream
economics
)
as
using
``
keynesian
language
and
apparatus
''
yet
rejecting
its
initial
conclusions.
he
theorized
that
there
existed
a
natural
rate
of
unemployment
and
argued
that
unemployment
below
this
rate
would
cause
inflation
to
accelerate.
he
argued
that
the
phillips
curve
was
in
the
long
run
vertical
at
the
``
natural
rate
''
and
predicted
what
would
come
to
be
known
as
stagflation.
friedman
promoted
a
macroeconomic
viewpoint
known
as
monetarism
and
argued
that
a
steady
,
small
expansion
of
the
money
supply
was
the
preferred
policy
,
as
compared
to
rapid
,
and
unexpected
changes.
his
ideas
concerning
monetary
policy
,
taxation
,
privatization
and
deregulation
influenced
government
policies
,
especially
during
the
<year>s.
his
monetary
theory
influenced
the
federal
reserve
's
monetary
policy
in
response
to
the
global
financial
crisis
of
<year>–<year>.after
retiring
from
the
university
of
chicago
in
<year>
,
and
becoming
emeritus
professor
in
economics
in
<year>
,
friedman
was
an
advisor
to
republican
president
ronald
reagan
and
conservative
british
prime
minister
margaret
thatcher.
his
political
philosophy
extolled
the
virtues
of
a
free
market
economic
system
with
minimal
government
intervention
in
social
matters.
he
once
stated
that
his
role
in
eliminating
conscription
in
the
united
states
was
his
proudest
achievement.
in
his
<year>
book
capitalism
and
freedom
,
friedman
advocated
policies
such
as
a
volunteer
military
,
freely
floating
exchange
rates
,
abolition
of
medical
licenses
,
a
negative
income
tax
and
school
vouchers
and
opposition
to
the
war
on
drugs
and
support
for
drug
liberalization
policies.
his
support
for
school
choice
led
him
to
found
the
friedman
foundation
for
educational
choice
,
later
renamed
edchoice.friedman
's
works
cover
a
broad
range
of
economic
topics
and
public
policy
issues.
his
books
and
essays
have
had
global
influence
,
including
in
former
communist
states.
a
<year>
survey
of
economists
commissioned
by

ejw
ranked
friedman
as
the
second-most
popular
economist
of
the
<integer>th
century
,
following
only
john
maynard
keynes.
upon
his
death
,
the

his
parents
,
sára
ethel
(
née

and
jenő
saul
friedman
,
were
jewish
working-class
immigrants
from
beregszász
in
carpathian
ruthenia
,
kingdom
of
hungary
(
now
berehove
in
ukraine
)
.
they
emigrated
to
america
in
their
early
teens.
they
both
worked
as
dry
goods
merchants.
friedman
was
their
fourth
child
and
only
son.
shortly
after
his
birth
,
the
family
relocated
to
rahway
,
new
jersey.friedman
's
family
experienced
financial
troubles
,
and
financial
uncertainty
caused
stability
of
income
to
be
low.
friedman
described
his
family
's
situation
in
the
following
manner
:
the
family
income
was
small
and
highly
uncertain
;
financial
crisis
was
a
constant
companion.
yet
there
was
always
enough
to
eat
,
and
the
family
atmosphere
was
warm
and
supportive.friedman
's
father
,
jenő
saul
friedman
,
died
during
friedman
's
senior

of
high
school
,
leaving
friedman
and
two
older
sisters
to
care
for
his
mother
,
sára
ethel
friedman.in
his
early
teens
,
friedman
was
injured
in
a
car
accident
,
which
scarred
his
upper
lip.
a
talented
student
and
an
avid
reader
,
friedman
graduated
from
rahway
high
school
in
<year>
,
just
before
his
<integer>th
birthday.
although
no
family
members
had
gone
to
university
before
milton
,
friedman
was
awarded
a
competitive
scholarship
to
rutgers
university
(
then
a
private
university
receiving
limited
support
from
the
state
of
new
jersey
,
e.g.
,
for
such
scholarships
)
.
friedman
was
expected
to
finance
the
cost
of
university
himself.
he
graduated
from
rutgers
in
<year>.friedman
initially
intended
to
become
an
actuary
or
mathematician
,
however
the
state
of
the
economy
,
which
was
at
this
point
in
a
deep
depression
,
convinced
him
to
become
an
economist.
he
was
offered
two
scholarships
to
do
graduate
work
,
one
in
mathematics
at
brown
university
and
the
other
in
economics
at
the
university
of
chicago
,
where
he
would
later
teach.
friedman
chose
the
latter
,
earning
a
master
of
arts
degree
in
<year>.
he
was
strongly
influenced
by
jacob
viner
,
frank
knight
,
and
henry
simons.
friedman
met
his
future
wife
,
economist
rose
director
,
while
at
the
university
of
chicago.during
the
<year>–<year>
academic
year
,
he
had
a
fellowship
at
columbia
university
,
where
he
studied
statistics
with
statistician
and
economist
harold
hotelling.
he
was
back
in
chicago
for
the
<year>–<year>
academic
year
,
working
as
a
research
assistant
for
henry
schultz
,
who
was
then
working
on
theory
and
measurement
of
demand.during
the
aforementioned
<year><integer>
academic
year
,
friedman
formed
what
would
later
prove
to
be
lifetime
friendships
with
george
stigler
and
w.
allen
wallis
,
both
of
whom
taught
with
friedman
at
the
university

chicago.
==
public
service
==
friedman
was
unable
to
find
academic
employment
,
so
in
<year>
he
followed
his
friend
w.
allen
wallis
to
washington
,
d.c.
,
where
franklin
d.
roosevelt
's
new
deal
was
``
a
lifesaver
''
for
many
young
economists.
at
this
stage
,
friedman
said
he
and
his
wife
``
regarded
the
job-creation
programs
such
as
the
wpa
,
ccc
,
and
pwa
appropriate
responses
to
the
critical
situation
,
''
but
not
``
the
price-
and
wage-fixing
measures
of
the
national
recovery
administration
and
the
agricultural
adjustment
administration.
''
foreshadowing
his
later
ideas
,
he
believed
price
controls
interfered
with
an
essential
signaling
mechanism
to
help
resources
be
used
where
they
were
most
valued.
indeed
,
friedman
later
concluded
that
all
government
intervention
associated
with
the
new
deal
was
``
the
wrong
cure
for
the
wrong
disease
,
''
arguing
the
federal
reserve
was
to
blame
,
and
that
they
should
have
expanded
the
money
supply
in
reaction
to
what
he
later
described
in
a
monetary
history
of
the
united
states
as
``
the
great
contraction.
''
later
,
friedman
and
his
colleague
anna
schwartz
wrote
a
monetary
history
of
the
united
states
,
<year>–<year>
,
which
argued
that
the
great
depression
was
caused
by
a
severe
monetary
contraction
due
to
banking
crises
and
poor
policy
on
the
part
of
the
federal
reserve.
robert
j.
shiller
describes
the
book
as
the
``
most
influential
account
''
of
the
great
depression.
during
<year>
,
he
began
working
for
the
national
resources
planning
board
,
which
was
then
working
on
a
large
consumer
budget
survey.
ideas
from
this
project
later
became
a
part
of
his
theory
of
the
consumption
function
,
a
book
which
first
described
consumption
smoothing
and
the
permanent
income
hypothesis.
friedman
began
employment
with
the
national
bureau
of
economic
research
during
the
autumn
of
<year>
to
assist
simon
kuznets
in
his
work
on
professional
income.
this
work
resulted
in
their
jointly
authored
publication
incomes
from
independent
professional
practice
,
which
introduced
the
concepts
of
permanent
and
transitory
income
,
a
major
component
of
the
permanent

hypothesis
that
friedman
worked
out
in
greater
detail
in

artificially
restricts
the
supply

raises

from

practice
remained
quite
controversial
within

economics
community
because
of
friedman
's
hypothesis
that
barriers
to
entry
,
which
were
exercised
and
enforced
by
the
american
medical
association
,
led
to
higher
than
average
wages

,
compared

====
a
theory
of
the
consumption
function
====
one
of
milton
friedman
's
most
popular
works
,
a
theory
of
the
consumption
function
,
challenged
traditional
keynesian
viewpoints
about
the
household.
this
work
was
originally
published
in
<year>
by
princeton
university
press
,
and
it
reanalyzed
the
relationship
displayed
``
between
aggregate
consumption
or
aggregate
savings
and
aggregate
income.
''
friedman
's
counterpart
keynes
believed
people
would
modify
their
household
consumption
expenditures
to
relate
to
their
existing
income
levels.
friedman
's
research
introduced
the
term
``
permanent
income
''
to
the
world
,
which
was
the
average
of
a
household
's
expected
income
over
several
years
,
and
he
also
developed
the
permanent
income
hypothesis.
friedman
thought
income
consisted
of
several
components
,
namely
transitory
and
permanent.
he
established
the
formula
y
=
y
p
+
y
t
{
\displaystyle
y=y_
{
p
}
+y_
{
t
}
}
in
order
to
calculate
income
,
with
p
representing
the
permanent
component
,
and
t
representing
the
transitory
component.milton
friedman
's
research
changed
how
economists
interpreted
the
consumption
function
,
and
his
work
pushed
the
idea
that
current
income
was
not
the
only
factor
affecting
people
's
adjustment
household
consumption
expenditures.
instead
,
expected
income
levels
also
affected
how
households
would
change
their
consumption
expenditures.
friedman
's
contributions
strongly
influenced
research
on
consumer
behavior
,
and
he
further
defined
how
to
predict
consumption
smoothing
,
which
contradicts
keynes
'
marginal
propensity
to
consume.
although
this
work
presented
many
controversial
points
of
view
which
differed
from
existing
viewpoints
established
by
keynes
,
a
theory
of
the
consumption
function
helped
friedman
gain
respect
in
the
field
of
economics.
his
work
on
the
permanent
income
hypothesis
is
among
the
many
contributions
which
were
listed
as
reasons
for
his
sveriges-riskbank
prize
in
economic
sciences.
his
work
was
later
expanded
on
by
christopher
d.
carroll
,
especially
in
regards
to
the
absence
of
liquidity
constraints.the
permanent
income
hypothesis
faces
some
criticism
,
mainly
from
keynesian
economists.
the
primary
criticism
of
the
hypothesis
is
based
on
a
lack
of
liquidity
constraints.

economics
===
friedman
was
best
known
for
reviving
interest
in
the
money
supply
as
a
determinant
of
the
nominal
value
of
output
,
that
is
,
the
quantity
theory
of
money.
monetarism
is
the
set
of
views
associated
with
modern
quantity
theory.
its
origins
can
be
traced
back
to
the
<integer>th-century
school
of
salamanca
or
even
further
;
however
,
friedman
's
contribution
is
largely
responsible
for
its
modern
popularization.
he
co-authored
,
with
anna
schwartz
,
a
monetary
history
of
the
united
states
,
<year>–<year>
(
<year>
)
,
which
was
an
examination
of
the
role
of
the
money
supply
and
economic
activity
in
the
u.s.
history.friedman
was
the
main
proponent
of
the
monetarist
school
of
economics.
he
maintained
that
there
is
a
close
and
stable
association
between
inflation
and
the
money
supply
,
mainly
that
inflation
could
be
avoided
with
proper
regulation
of
the
monetary
base
's
growth
rate.
he
famously
used
the
analogy
of
``
dropping
money
out
of
a
helicopter
''
,
in
order
to
avoid
dealing
with
money
injection
mechanisms
and
other
factors
that
would
overcomplicate
his
models.friedman
's
arguments
were
designed
to
counter
the
popular
concept
of
cost-push
inflation
,
that
the
increased
general
price
level
at
the
time
was
the
result
of
increases
in
the
price
of
oil
,
or
increases
in
wages
;
as
he
wrote
:
inflation
is
always
and
everywhere
a
monetary
phenomenon.
friedman
rejected
the
use
of
fiscal
policy
as
a
tool
of
demand
management
;
and
he
held
that
the
government
's
role
in
the
guidance
of
the
economy
should
be
restricted
severely.
friedman
wrote
extensively
on
the
great
depression
,
and
he
termed
the
<year>–<year>
period
the
great
contraction.
he
argued
that
the
depression
had
been
caused
by
an
ordinary
financial
shock
whose
duration
and
seriousness
were
greatly
increased
by
the
subsequent
contraction
of
the
money
supply
caused
by
the
misguided
policies
of
the
directors
of
the
federal
reserve.
the
fed
was
largely
responsible
for
converting
what
might
have
been
a
garden-variety
recession
,
although
perhaps
a
fairly
severe
one
,
into
a
major
catastrophe.
instead
of
using
its
powers
to
offset
the
depression
,
it
presided
over
a
decline
in
the
quantity
of
money
by
one-third
from
<year>
to
<year>
...
far
from
the
depression
being
a
failure
of
the
free-enterprise
system
,
it
was
a
tragic
failure
of
government.
this
theory
was
put
forth
in
a
monetary
history
of
the
united
states
,
and
the
chapter
on
the
great
depression
was
then
published
as
a
stand-alone
book
entitled
the
great
contraction
,
<year>–<year>.
both
books
are
still
in
print
from
the
princeton
university
press
,
and
some
editions
include
as
an
appendix
a
speech
at
a
university
of
chicago
event
honoring
friedman
in
which
ben
bernanke
made
this
statement
:
let
me
end
my
talk
by
abusing
slightly
my
status
as
an
official
representative
of
the
federal
reserve.
i
would
like
to
say
to
milton
and
anna
:
regarding
the
great
depression
,
you
're
right.
we
did
it.
we
're
very
sorry.
but
thanks
to
you
,
we
wo
n't
do
it
again.
friedman
also
argued
for
the
removal
of
government
intervention
in
currency
markets
,
thereby
spawning
an
enormous
literature
on
the
subject
,
as
well
as
promoting
the
practice
of
freely
floating
exchange
rates.
his
close
friend
george
stigler
explained
,
``
as
is
customary
in
science
,
he
did
not
win
a
full
victory
,
in
part
because
research
was
directed
along
different
lines
by
the
theory
of
rational
expectations
,
a
newer
approach
developed
by
robert
lucas
,
also
at
the
university
of
chicago.
''
the
relationship
between
friedman
and
lucas
,
or
new
classical
macroeconomics
as
a
whole
,
was
highly
complex.
the
friedmanian
phillips
curve
was
an
interesting
starting
point
for
lucas
,
but
he
soon
realized
that
the
solution
provided
by
friedman
was
not
quite
satisfactory.
lucas
elaborated
a
new
approach
in
which
rational
expectations
were
presumed
instead
of
the
friedmanian
adaptive
expectations.
due
to
this
reformulation
,
the
story
in
which
the
theory
of
the
new
classical
phillips
curve
was
embedded
radically
changed.
this
modification
,
however
,
had
a
significant
effect
on
friedman
's
own
approach
,
so
,
as
a
result
,
the
theory
of
the
friedmanian
phillips
curve
also
changed.
moreover
,
new
classical
adherent
neil
wallace
,
who
was
a
graduate
student
at
the
university
of
chicago
between
<year>
and
<year>
,
regarded
friedman
's
theoretical
courses
as
a
mess
,
highlighting
the
strained
relationship
between
monetarism
and
new
classical
schools.friedman
was
also
known
for
his
work
on
the
consumption
function
,
the
permanent
income
hypothesis
(
<year>
)
,
which
friedman
himself
referred
to
as
his
best
scientific
work.
this
work
contended
that
utility-maximizing
consumers
would
spend
a
proportional
amount
of
what
they
perceived
to
be
their
permanent
income.
permanent
income
refers
to
such
factors
like
human
capital.
windfall
gains
would
mostly
be
saved
because
of
the
law
of
diminishing
marginal
utility.friedman
's
essay
``
the
methodology
of
positive
economics
''
(
<year>
)
provided
the
epistemological
pattern
for
his
own
subsequent
research
and
to
a
degree
that
of
the
chicago
school.
there
he
argued
that
economics
as
science
should
be
free
of
value
judgments
for
it
to
be
objective.
moreover
,
a
useful
economic
theory
should
be
judged
not
by
its
descriptive
realism
but
by
its
simplicity
and
fruitfulness
as
an
engine
of
prediction.
that
is
,
students
should
measure
the
accuracy
of
its
predictions
,
rather
than
the
'soundness
of
its
assumptions'.
his
argument
was
part
of
an
ongoing
debate
among
such
statisticians
as
jerzy
neyman
,
leonard
savage
,
and
ronald
fisher.however
,
despite
being
an
advocate
of
the
free
market
,
milton
friedman
believed
that
the
government
had
two
crucial
roles.
in
an
interview
with
phil
donahue
,
milton
friedman
argued
that
``
the
two
basic
functions
of
a
government
are
to
protect
the
nation
against
foreign
enemy
,
and
to
protect
citizens
against
its
fellows.”
he
also
admitted
that
although
privatization
of
national
defense
could
reduce
the
overall
cost
,
he
has
not
yet
thought
of
a
way
to
make
this
privatization
possible.
===
rejection
and
subsequent
evolution
of
the
philips
curve
===
other
important
contributions
include
his
critique
of
the
phillips
curve
and
the
concept
of
the
natural
rate
of
unemployment
(
<year>
)
.
this
critique
associated
his
name
,
together
with
that
of
edmund
phelps
,
with
the
insight
that
a
government
that
brings
about
greater
inflation
can
not
permanently
reduce
unemployment
by
doing
so.
unemployment
may
be
temporarily
lower
,
if
the
inflation
is
a
surprise
,
but
in
the
long
run
unemployment
will
be
determined
by
the
frictions
and
imperfections
of
the
labor
market.
if
the
conditions
are
not
met
and
inflation
is
expected
,
the
``
long
run
''
effects
will
replace
the
``
short
term
''
effects.through
his
critique
,
the
philips
curve
evolved
from
a
strict
model
emphasizing
the
connection
between
inflation
and
unemployment
as
being
absolute
,
to
a
model
which
emphasized
short
term
unemployment
reductions
and
long
term
employment
stagnations.friedman
's
revised
and
updated
phillips
curve
also
changed
as
a
result
of
robert
lucas
's
idea
of
rational
expectations
,
replacing
the
adaptive
expectations
friedman
used.
===
statistics
===
one
of
his
most
famous
contributions
to
statistics
is
sequential
sampling.
friedman
did
statistical
work
at
the
division
of
war
research
at
columbia
,
where
he
and
his
colleagues
came
up
with
the
technique.
it
became
,
in
the
words
of
the
new
palgrave
dictionary
of
economics
,
``
the
standard
analysis
of
quality
control
inspection
''
.
the
dictionary
adds
,
``
like
many
of
friedman
's
contributions
,
in
retrospect
it
seems
remarkably
simple
and
obvious
to
apply
basic
economic
ideas
to
quality
control
;
that
,
however
,
is
a
measure
of
his
genius.
''
==
public
policy
positions
==
===
federal
reserve
and
monetary
policy
===
although
friedman
concluded
the
government
does
have
a
role
in
the
monetary
system
he
was
critical
of
the
federal
reserve
due
to
its
poor
performance
and
felt
it
should
be
abolished.
he
was
opposed
to
federal
reserve
policies
,
even
during
the
so-called
'volcker
shock
'
that
was
labeled
'monetarist'.
friedman
believed
the
federal
reserve
system
should
ultimately
be
replaced
with
a
computer
program.
he
favored
a
system
that
would
automatically
buy
and
sell
securities
in
response
to
changes
in
the
money
supply.the
proposal
to
constantly
grow
the
money
supply
at
a
certain
predetermined
amount
every
year
has
become
known
as
friedman
's
k-percent
rule.
there
is
debate
about
the
effectiveness
of
a
theoretical
money
supply
targeting
regime.
the
fed
's
inability
to
meet
its
money
supply
targets
from
<year>–<year>
led
some
to
conclude
it
is
not
a
feasible
alternative
to
more
conventional
inflation
and
interest
rate
targeting.
towards
the
end
of
his
life
,
friedman
expressed
doubt
about
the
validity
of
targeting
the
quantity
of
money.
to
date
,
most
countries
have
adopted
inflation
targeting
instead
of
the
k-percent
rule.idealistically
,
friedman
actually
favored
the
principles
of
the
<year>s
chicago
plan
,
which
would
have
ended
fractional
reserve
banking
and
,
thus
,
private
money
creation.
it
would
force
banks
to
have
<integer>
%
reserves
backing
deposits
,
and
instead
place
money
creation
powers
solely
in
the
hands
of
the
us
government.
this
would
make
targeting
money
growth
more
possible
,
as
endogenous
money
created
by
fractional
reserve
lending
would
no
longer
be
a
major
issue.friedman
was
a
strong
advocate
for
floating
exchange
rates
throughout
the
entire
bretton-woods
period
(
<year>-<year>
)
.
he
argued
that
a
flexible
exchange
rate
would
make
external
adjustment
possible
and
allow
countries
to
avoid
balance
of
payments
crises.
he
saw
fixed
exchange
rates
as
an
undesirable
form
of
government
intervention.
the
case
was
articulated
in
an
influential
<year>
paper
,
``
the
case
for
flexible
exchange
rates
,
''
at
a
time
when
most
commentators
regarded
the
possibility
of
floating
exchange
rates
as
an
unrealistic
policy
proposal.
===
foreign
policy
===
while
walter
oi
is
credited
with
establishing
the
economic
basis
for
a
volunteer
military
,
friedman
was
a
proponent
,
and
was
credited
with
ending
the
draft
,
stating
that
the
draft
was
``
inconsistent
with
a
free
society.
''
in
capitalism
and
freedom
,
he
argued
conscription
is
inequitable
and
arbitrary
,
preventing
young
men
from
shaping
their
lives
as
they
see
fit.
during
the
nixon

believe
the

military
training

a
reserve
in

could
be
justified.
he
still
opposed

describing
it
as
a
“monstrosity”.biographer

views
from
an
interventionist
to
a
more
cautious
foreign
policy.
he
supported
us
involvement

supported

friedman
said
the

''
===
governmental
involvement
in
the
economy
===
friedman
was
supportive
of
the
state
provision
of
some
public
goods
that
private
businesses
are
not
considered
as
being
able
to
provide.
however
,
he
argued
that
many
of
the
services
performed
by
government
could
be
performed
better
by
the
private
sector.
above
all
,
if
some
public
goods
are
provided
by
the
state
,
he
believed
that
they
should
not
be
a
legal
monopoly
where
private
competition
is
prohibited
;
for
example
,
he
wrote
:
there
is
no
way
to
justify
our
present
public
monopoly
of
the
post
office.
it
may
be
argued
that
the
carrying
of
mail
is
a
technical
monopoly
and
that
a
government
monopoly
is
the
least
of
evils.
along
these
lines
,
one
could
perhaps
justify
a
government
post
office
,
but
not
the
present
law
,
which
makes
it
illegal
for
anybody
else
to
carry
the
mail.
if
the
delivery
of
mail
is
a
technical
monopoly
,
no
one
else
will
be
able
to
succeed
in
competition
with
the
government.
if
it
is
not
,
there
is
no
reason
why
the
government
should
be
engaged
in
it.
the
only
way
to
find
out
is
to
leave
other
people
free
to
enter.in
<year>
,
friedman
criticized
social
security
in
his
book
capitalism
and
freedom
,
arguing
that
it
had
created
welfare
dependency.
however
,
in
the
penultimate
chapter
of
the
same
book
,
friedman
argued
that
while
capitalism
had
greatly
reduced
the
extent
of
poverty
in
absolute
terms
,
``
poverty
is
in
part
a
relative
matter
,
[
and
]
even
in
[
wealthy
western
]
countries
,
there
are
clearly
many
people
living
under
conditions
that
the
rest
of
us
label
as
poverty.
''
friedman
also
noted
that
while
private
charity
could
be
one
recourse
for
alleviating
poverty
and
cited
late
<integer>th
century
britain
and
the
united
states
as
exemplary
periods
of
extensive
private
charity
and
eleemosynary
activity
,
he
made
the
following
point
:
it
can
be
argued
that
private
charity
is
insufficient
because
the
benefits
from
it
accrue
to
people
other
than
those
who
make
the
gifts—
...
a
neighborhood
effect.
i
am
distressed
by
the
sight
of
poverty
;
i
am
benefited
by
its
alleviation
;
but
i
am
benefited
equally
whether
i
or
someone
else
pays
for
its
alleviation
;
the
benefits
of
other
people
's
charity
therefore
partly
accrue
to
me.
to
put
it
differently
,
we
might
all
of
us
be
willing
to
contribute
to
the
relief
of
poverty
,
provided
everyone
else
did.
we
might
not
be
willing
to
contribute
the
same
amount
without
such
assurance.
in
small
communities
,
public
pressure
can
suffice
to
realize
the
proviso
even
with
private
charity.
in
the
large
impersonal
communities
that
are
increasingly
coming
to
dominate
our
society
,
it
is
much
more
difficult
for
it
to
do
so.
suppose
one
accepts
,
as
i
do
,
this
line
of
reasoning
as
justifying
governmental
action
to
alleviate
poverty
;
to
set
,
as
it
were
,
a
floor
under
the
standard
of
life
of
every
person
in
the
community.
[
while
there
are
questions
of
how
much
should
be
spent
and
how
,
the
]
arrangement
that
recommends
itself
on
purely
mechanical
grounds
is
a
negative
income
tax.
...
the
advantages
of
this
arrangement
are
clear.
it
is
directed
specifically
at
the
problem
of
poverty.
it
gives
help
in
the
form
most
useful
to
the
individual
,
namely
,
cash.
it
is
general
and
could
be
substituted
for
the
host
of
special
measures
now
in
effect.
it
makes
explicit
the
cost
borne
by
society.
it
operates
outside
the
market.
like
any
other
measures
to
alleviate
poverty
,
it
reduces
the
incentives
of
those
helped
to
help
themselves
,
but
it
does
not
eliminate
that
incentive
entirely
,
as
a
system
of
supplementing
incomes
up
to
some
fixed
minimum
would.
an
extra
dollar
earned
always
means
more
money
available
for
expenditure.
friedman
argued
further
that
other
advantages
of
the
negative
income
tax
were
that
it
could
fit
directly
into
the
tax
system
,
would
be
less
costly
,
and
would
reduce
the
administrative
burden
of
implementing
a
social
safety
net.
friedman
reiterated
these
arguments
<integer>
years
later
in
free
to
choose
,
with
the
additional
proviso
that
such
a
reform
would
only
be
satisfactory
if
it
replaced
the
current
system
of
welfare
programs
rather
than
augment
it.
according
to
economist
robert
h.
frank
,
writing
in
the
new
york
times
,
friedman
's
views
in
this
regard
were
grounded
in
a
belief
that
while
``
market
forces
...
accomplish
wonderful
things
''
,
they
``
can
not
ensure
a
distribution
of
income
that
enables
all
citizens
to
meet
basic
economic
needs
''
.in
<year>
,
friedman
expressed
support
for
ecotaxes
in
general
in
an
interview
on
the
phil
donahue
show
,
saying
``
the
best
way
to
[
deal
with
pollution
]
is
to
impose
a
tax
on
the
cost
of
the
pollutants
emitted
by
a
car
and
make
an
incentive
for
car
manufacturers
and
for
consumers
to
keep
down
the
amount
of
pollution.
''
in
free
to
choose
,
friedman
reiterated
his
support
for
ecotaxes
as
compared
with
increased
environmental
regulation
,
stating
``
the
preservation
of
the
environment
and
the
avoidance
of
undue
pollution
are
real
problems
and
they
are
problems
concerning
which
the
government
has
an
important
role
to
play.
…
most
economists
agree
that
a
far
better
way
to
control
pollution
than
the
present
method
of
specific
regulation
and
supervision
is
to
introduce
market
discipline
by
imposing
effluent
charges.
''
in
his
<year>
article
``
the
role
of
government
in
education
''
friedman
proposed
supplementing
publicly
operated
schools
with
privately
run
but
publicly
funded
schools
through
a
system
of
school
vouchers.
reforms
similar
to
those
proposed

in

,
friedman
,
together
with

founded
the
friedman

for

to
advocate
school

and

in
<year>
,
the

changed

friedman

described

.friedman
argued
for
stronger
basic

social
issues
===
friedman
also
supported
libertarian
policies
such
as
legalization
of
drugs
and
prostitution.
during
<year>
,
friedman
and
more
than
<integer>
other
economists
advocated
discussions
regarding
the
economic
benefits
of
the
legalization
of
marijuana.friedman
was
also
a
supporter
of
gay
rights.
he
never
specifically
supported
same-sex
marriage
,
instead
saying
``
i
do
not
believe
there
should
be
any
discrimination
against
gays.
''
friedman
favored
immigration
,
saying
``
legal
and
illegal
immigration
has
a
very
positive
impact
on
the
u.s.
economy.
''
however
,
he
suggested
that
immigrants
ought
not
to
have
access
to
the
welfare
system.
friedman
stated
that
immigration
from
mexico
had
been
a
``
good
thing
''
,
in
particular
illegal
immigration.
friedman
argued
that
illegal
immigration
was
a
boon
because
they
``
take
jobs
that
most
residents
of
this
country
are
unwilling
to
take

a
kind
they
can
not
get
''
and
they
do
not
use
welfare.
in
free
to
choose
,
friedman
wrote
:
no
arbitrary
obstacles
should
prevent
people
from
achieving
those
positions
for
which
their
talents
fit
them
and
which
their
values
lead
them
to
seek.
not
birth
,
nationality
,
color
,
religion

sex
,
nor
any
other
irrelevant
characteristic
should
determine
the
opportunities
that
are
open
to
a
person
—
only
his
abilities.friedman
also
famously
argued
that
the
welfare
state
must
end
before
immigration
,
or
more
specifically
,
before
open
borders
,
because
immigrants
might
have
an
incentive
to
come
directly
because
of
welfare
payments.
economist
bryan
caplan
has
disputed
this
assertion
,
arguing
that
welfare
is
generally
distributed
not
among
immigrants
,
but
instead
retirees
,
through
social
security.friedman
was
against
public
housing
as
he
believed
it
was
also
a
form
of
welfare.
he
believed
the
one
of
the
main
arguments
that
politicians
have
for
public
housing
is
that
regular
low
income
housing
was
too
expensive
due
to
the
imposed
higher
cost
of
a
fire
and
police
department.
he
believed
that
it
would
only
increase
taxes
and
not
benefit
low
income
people
in
the
long
run.
friedman
was
an
advocate
for
direct
cash
instead
of
public
housing
believing
that
the
people
would
be
better
off
that
way.
he
argued
that
liberals
would
never
agree
with
this
idea
due
to
them
not
trusting
their
own
citizens.
he
also
stated
that
regression
has
already
happened
with
more
land
being
left
vacant
due
to
slow
construction.
friedman
argued
that
public
housing
instead
encourages
juvenile
delinquency.friedman
was
also
against
minimum
wage
laws
,
he
saw
them
as
a
clear
case
as
one
can
find
that
the
precise
opposite
is
happening
when
this
was
attempted.
minimum
wage
laws
would
increase
unemployment
in
his
eyes
and
that
employers
would
not
hire
back
workers
that
were
already
there
for
less
pay.
in
his
view
,
this
would
leave
low
income
people
worse
off
because
the
voters
for
minimum
wage
laws
would
then
become
the
victims
of
unemployment.
he
believed
that
these
ideas
of
new
minimum
wage
laws
came
from
northern
factories
and
unions
,
in
an
attempt
to
reduce
competition
from
the
south.

chile

during

,
two
years
after
the
military
coup
that
brought
military
dictator
president
augusto
pinochet
to
power
and
ended
the
government
of
salvador
allende
,
the
economy
of
chile
experienced
a
severe
crisis.
friedman
and
arnold
harberger
accepted
an
invitation
of
a
private
chilean
foundation
to
visit
chile
and
speak
on
principles
of
economic
freedom.
he
spent
seven
days
in
chile
giving
a
series
of
lectures
at
the
universidad
católica
de
chile
and
the
(
national
)
university
of
chile.
one
of
the
lectures
was
entitled
``
the
fragility
of
freedom
''
and
according
to
friedman
,
``
dealt
with
precisely
the
threat
to
freedom
from
a
centralized
military
government.
''
in
a
letter
to
pinochet
of
april
<integer>
,
<year>
,
friedman
considered
the
``
key
economic
problems
of
chile
are
clearly
...
inflation
and
the
promotion
of
a
healthy
social
market
economy
''
.
he
stated
that
``
there
is
only
one
way
to
end
inflation
:
by
drastically
reducing
the
rate
of
increase
of
the
quantity
of
money
''
and
that
``
cutting
government
spending
is
by
far
and
away
the
most
desirable
way
to
reduce
the
fiscal
deficit
,
because
it
...
strengthens
the
private
sector
thereby
laying
the
foundations
for
healthy
economic
growth
''
.
as
to
how
rapidly
inflation
should
be
ended
,
friedman
felt
that
``
for
chile
where
inflation
is
raging
at
<integer>–<integer>
%
a
month
...
gradualism
is
not
feasible.
it
would
involve
so
painful
an
operation
over
so
long
a
period
that
the
patient
would
not
survive.
''
choosing
``
a
brief
period
of
higher
unemployment
''
was
the
lesser
evil..
and
that
``
the
experience
of
germany
,
...
of
brazil
...
,
of
the
post-war
adjustment
in
the
u.s.
...
all
argue
for
shock
treatment
''
.
in
the
letter
friedman
recommended
to
deliver
the
shock
approach
with
``
a
package
to
eliminate
the
surprise
and
to
relieve
acute
distress
''
and
``
for
definiteness
let
me
sketch
the
contents
of
a
package
proposal
...
to
be
taken
as
illustrative
''
although
his
knowledge
of
chile
was
``
too
limited
to
enable
[
him
]
to
be
precise
or
comprehensive
''
.
he
listed
a
``
sample
proposal
''
of
<integer>
monetary
and
fiscal
measures
including
``
the
removal
of
as
many
as
obstacles
as
possible
that
now
hinder
the
private
market.
for
example
,
suspend
...
the
present
law
against
discharging
employees
''
.
he
closed
,
stating
``
such
a
shock
program
could
end
inflation
in
months
''
.
his
letter
suggested
that
cutting
spending
to
reduce
the
fiscal
deficit
would
result
in
less
transitional
unemployment
than
raising
taxes.

defended
his
activity
in

on
the
grounds
that
,
in
his
opinion
,
the
adoption
of
free
market
policies
not
only
improved
the
economic
situation
of

also
contributed

the
amelioration
of

and
to
the
eventual
transition
to

that
idea
is
included
in
capitalism

,
in
which
he
declared
that
economic
freedom
is
not

desirable
in
itself
but
is
also
a
necessary
condition
for
political
freedom.
in

he
said
the
following
:
``
chile

not
a

and
i
do
not
condone

but
the

been
getting
better

to
be
able
to
have
a

''
in
<year>
,
friedman
stated
that
he
has
``
never
refrained
from
criticizing
the
political
system
in
chile.
''
in
<year>
he
said
:
``
i
have
nothing
good
to
say
about
the
political
regime
that
pinochet
imposed.
it
was
a
terrible
political
regime.
the
real
miracle
of
chile
is
not
how
well
it
has
done
economically
;
the
real
miracle
of
chile
is
that
a
military
junta
was
willing
to
go
against
its
principles
and
support
a
free
market
regime
designed
by
principled
believers
in
a

market.
...
in
chile
,
the
drive
for
political
freedom
,
that
was
generated
by
economic
freedom
and
the
resulting
economic
success
,
ultimately
resulted
in
a
referendum
that
introduced
political
democracy.
now
,
at

last
,
chile
has
all
three
things
:
political
freedom
,
human
freedom
and
economic
freedom.
chile
will
continue
to
be
an
interesting
experiment
to
watch
to
see
whether
it
can
keep
all
three
or
whether
,
now
that
it
has
political

that
political
freedom
will
tend
to
be
used
to
destroy
or
reduce
economic
freedom.
''
he
stressed
that
the
lectures
he
gave
in
chile
were
the
same
lectures
he
later
gave
in
china
and
other
socialist
states.
he
further
stated
``
i
do
not
consider
it
as
evil
for
an
economist
to
render
technical
economic
advice

continued
to
argue
that
``
free

would
undermine
[
pinochet

]
political
centralization

political
control.
''
,
and
that
criticism
over
his
role
in
chile
missed
his
main
contention
that
freer
markets
resulted
in
freer
people
,
and
that
chile
's
unfree
economy
had
caused
pinochet
's
rise.
friedman
advocated
for
free
markets
which
undermined
``
political
centralization
and
political
control
''
.because
of
his
involvement
with
the
government
of
chile
,
which
was
a
dictatorship
at
the
time

there
were
international
protests
,
spanning
from
sweden
to
america
when
friedman
was
awarded
the
nobel
memorial
prize
in
<year>.
friedman
was
accused
of
supporting
the
military
dictatorship
in
chile
because
of
the
relation
of
economists
of
the
university
of
chicago
to
pinochet
,
and

seven-day
trip
he
took
to
chile
during

(
less
than
two
years
after
the
coup
that
ended
with
the
death
of

)
.
friedman
answered
that
he
was
never
an
advisor
to
the
dictatorship
,
but
only
gave
some
lectures
and
seminars
on
inflation
,
and
met
with

pinochet
the
head
of
the
military
dictatorship
,
while
in

after
a
<year>
speech
on

legalization
,
friedman
answered
a
question
on
his

,
saying
that
he
was
never
an
advisor
to
pinochet
(
also

<year>
iceland
interview
)
,
but
that
a
group
university
of
chicago
students
were
involved
in
chile
's
economic
reforms.
friedman
credited
these
reforms
with
high
levels
of
economic
growth
and
with
the
establishment
of
democracy
that
has
subsequently
occurred
in

gave
a
lecture
at

for
attending
his
lecture
at
the
university
and
that
,
hitherto
,
lectures

visiting
scholars
had
been
free-of-charge
,
friedman
replied
that
previous
lectures
had
not
been
free-of-charge
in
a
meaningful
sense
:
lectures
always
have
related
costs.
what
mattered
was
whether
attendees
or
non-attendees
covered
those
costs.
friedman
thought
that
it
was
fairer
that
only
those
who
attended
paid.
in

discussion
friedman
also
stated
that
he
did
not
receive
any
money
for
delivering
that

mart
laar
,
who
has
claimed
that
it
was
the
only

transforming
estonia
from
an

a

element

criticized
part

's
<year>
monetary
trends.
when
asked
about
it
during
an
interview
with
icelandic

friedman
said
that
the
criticism
referred
to
a
different
problem
from
that
which
he
and
schwartz
had
tackled
,
and
hence
was
irrelevant

pointed
out
the
lack
of

peer
review
amongst

on
hendry

said
that

meant
``
the

not
open
enough
,
in

to
the
possibility

market
inefficiencies.
economist
noah
smith
argues
that
while
friedman
made
many
important
contributions
to
economic
theory
not
all
of
his
ideas
relating
to
macroeconomics
have
entirely
held
up
over

and
that

few
people
are
willing

challenge
them.political
scientist
c.b.
macpherson
disagreed
with
friedman

historical
assessment
of
economic
freedom
leading
to
political
freedom
,
suggesting
that
political
freedom
actually
gave
way
to
economic
freedom
for
property-owning
elites.
he
also
challenged
the
notion
that
markets
efficiently
allocated
resources
and
rejected
friedman

liberty.
friedman

positivist
methodological
approach

been
critiqued

debated.
finnish

some

unrealistic

vague.noam
chomsky
suggested
in

the
primary
role
of

has
been
criticized
by

prominent
austrian
economists

called
friedman
a
``

,
and
was
critical

saying
``

some

have
raised
questions

nobel-prize
winning
economist
paul
krugman
argued
that
the

proved
that
,
during

,
a
central
bank
can
not
control
broad
money
(
m3

defined

even
if

,
the

according
to
krugman
,
this
was
true
in

the
claim
that
the

could
have
avoided
the

is
``
highly

to
understanding

point
in

the
chief
monetary
system

this
was
because

the

not
undertake
actions

criticized

jean
hanson
(
<day>
–
<day>
)
was
a
biophysicist
and
zoologist
known
for
her
contributions
to
muscle
research.
hanson
gained
her
phd
in
zoology
from
bedford
college
,
university
of
london
before
spending
the
majority
of
her
career
at
a
biophysics
research
unit
at
king
's
college
london
,
where
she
was
a
founder
member
,
and
later
its
second
head.
while
working
at
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
,
she
,
with
hugh
huxley
,
discovered
the
mechanism
of
movement
of
muscle
fibre
in
<year>
,
which
came
to
known
as
``
sliding
filament
theory
''
.
this
was
a
groundbreaking
research
in
muscle
physiology
,
and
for
this
bbc
nicknamed
her
``
mrs
muscle
''
on
the
<integer>th

early
life
==
hanson
was
born
on
<day>
in
newhall
,
derbyshire
,
england
,
the
only
child
of
tom
and
emily
hanson.
her
parents
were
both
school
teachers.
she
was
raised
solely
by
her
mother
after
her
father
died
of
a
brain
tumour
soon
after
her
birth.
through
her
mother
's
active
encouragement
,
hanson
developed
a
keen
interest
in
music
and
the
arts.
she
attended
the
girl
's
high
school
in
burton
upon
trent
from
<year>

age
of
fifteen
,
while

school
,
she
developed
her
interest
in
biology.
at
the

,
she
took
the
higher
school
certificate
gaining
distinction
in
english

she
was
awarded
a
scholarship
to
attend
bedford
college
london
after
taking
its
entrance
examination
in
botany
,
zoology
and
physiology.
hanson
began
at
bedford
college
in
<year>
,
taking
its
intermediate
examination
in
zoology
,
botany
,
chemistry
and
physiology
the
following
year
,
graduating
with
first-class
honours
in
zoology
with
a
minor
in
botany
in
<year>.
as
a
post-graduate
research
student
,
hanson
began
studying
the
vascular
system
of
annelids.
however
this
research
was
interrupted
between
<year>–<integer>
when
bedford
college
were
evacuated
to
cambridge
due
to
world
war
ii.
during
two
years
at
cambridge
,
she
worked
at
the
strangeways
laboratory
on
the
histogenesis
and
differentiation
of
epidermis.
between
<year>

<year>
she
worked
as
demonstrator
in
zoology.
==
career
==
jean
hanson
joined
the
king
's
college
london
in
<year>
in
the
newly
established
biophysics
department.
the
department
was
under
john
randall
,
who
invited
her
to
establish
the
biological
section.
she
worked
on
muscle
fibres
and
obtained
her
phd
in
<year>.
in
february
<year>
she
went
to
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
with
a
one-year
rockefeller
fellowship
and
joined
a
fellow
english
postdoc
hugh
huxley
to
work
in
f.
o.
schmitt
's
laboratory.
together
they
discovered
the
so-called
``
sliding
filament
theory
''
,
the
underpinning
idea
on
muscle
contraction.
their
publication
in
the
<day>
issue
of
nature
became
a
landmark
in
muscle
physiology.
they
provided
the
strong
evidence
for
the
theory
in
<year>
,
in
which
they
showed
electron
microscopic
details
of
the
shortening
and
elongation
of
muscle
fibres
against
each
other.
even
then
the
theory
was
not
easily
embraced
,
even
in
<year>
at
a
symposium
of
biomacromolecules
held
in
pittsburgh
,
pasadena
,
scientists
including
the
nobel
laureate
paul
flory
argued
against
the
sliding
process.
hanson
was
remembered
reacting
,
``
i
know
i
can
not
explain
the
mechanism
yet
,
but
the
sliding
is
a
fact.
''
after
their
work
in
us
,
hanson
and
huxley
decided
to
separate
their
lines
of
muscle
research
,
and
hanson
took
up
those
of
invertebrate
animals.
in
<year>
she
became
full
professor
of
biology
at
king's.
in
<year>
,
she
succeeded
randall
as
director
of
the
biophysics
unit
,
where
she
remained
until
her
death
in
<year>.
==

jean
hanson
was
elected
a
fellow
of
the
royal
society
in
<year>.
==
personal
life
and
death
==
jean
hanson
was
very
unlike
the
other
members
of
the
king
's
,
who
were
famous
for
their
antagonism
among
themselves.
she
was
generous
,
open-minded
,
and
most
of
all
,
eager
to
help
young
researchers.
she
was
known
as
'jean
'
to
all.
(
she
never
used
her
first
name
,
even
in
her
publications.
)
huxley
noted
that
since
their
research
area
overlapped
there
could
have
been
serious
conflict
as
they
worked
in
different
institutes.
foreseeing
this
hanson
chose
to
work
only
in
invertebrate
animals
,
and
to
such
sensible
and
modest
decision
huxley
remarked
:
would
that
it
was
always
so
!
she
died
in
london
on
<day>
from
a
rare
brain
infection

,
where
his

born
in

(
née

.
he
had
a
brother
philip
and
a
sister
pamela.
(
pamela
was
later
married
to
sir
david
hunt
,
who
served
as
private
secretary
to
prime
ministers
clement
attlee
and
winston
churchill.
)
his
father
,
a
christian
maronite
,
became
a
naturalised
british
citizen
and
worked
for
a
british
dental
supplies
manufacturer
that
sent
him
to
brazil
as
an
agent.
(
he
later
described
his
father
's
profession
as
selling
``
false
teeth
in
south
america
''
.
)
his
status
as
a
british
citizen
was
acquired
at
birth
,
as
he
said
,
``
my
birth
was
registered
at
the
british
consulate
in
good
time
to
acquire
the
status
of
'natural-born
british
subject'.
''
medawar
left
brazil
with
his
family
for
england
``
towards
the
end
of
the
war
''
,
and
he
lived
there
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
he
was
also
a
brazilian
citizen
by
birth
,
as
dictated
by
the
brazilian

law
(
jus

)
.
at
<integer>
years
,
when
he
was
of
age
to
be
drafted
in
the

,
he
applied
for
exemption
of

conscription
to
joaquim
pedro
salgado
filho
,
his
godfather
and
the
then
minister
of
aviation.
his
application
was
denied
by
general
eurico
gaspar
dutra
,
and
he
had
to
renounce
his
brazilian
citizenship.in
<year>
,
medawar
went
to
marlborough
college
in
marlborough
,
wiltshire.
he
hated
the
college
because
``
they
were
critical
and
querulous
at
the
same
time
,
wondering
what
kind
of
person
a
lebanese
was—something
foreign
you
can
be
sure
''
.
and
also
because
of
its
preference
on
sports
,
in
which
he
was
weak.
an
experience
of
bullying
and
racism
made
him
feel
the
rest
of
his
life
``
resentful
and
disgusted
at
the
manners
and
mores
of
[
marlborough
's
]
essentially
tribal
institution
,
''
and
likened
it
to
the
training
schools
for
the
nazi
ss
as
all
``
founded
upon
the
twin
pillars
of
sex
and
sadism.
''
his
proudest
moments
at
the
college
were
with
his
teacher
ashley
gordon
lowndes
,
to
whom
he
credited
the
beginning
of
his
career
in
biology.
he
recognised
lowndes
as
barely
literate
but
``
a
very
,
very
good
biology
teacher
''
.
lowndes
had
taught
eminent
biologists
including
john
z.
young
and
richard
julius
pumphrey.
yet
medawar
was
inherently
weak
in
dissection
and
was
constantly
irked
by
their
dictum
:
``
bloody
foolish
is
the
boy
whose
drawing
of
his
dissection
differs
in
any
way
whatsoever
from
the

in

because
of
the
prohibitive
cost
of
supplication

,
he
spent
the

in

reading
the

it
was
published

's
involvement
with
what
became
transplant
research
began
during
world
war
ii
,
when
he
investigated
possible
improvements
in
skin
grafts.
his
first
publication
on
the
subject
was
``
sheets
of
pure
epidermal
epithelium
from
human
skin
''
,
which
was
published
in
nature
in
<year>.
his
studies
particularly
concerned
solution
for
skin
wounds
among
soldiers
in
the

in
<year>
,
he
moved
to
the
university
of
birmingham
,
taking
along
with
him
his
phd
student
leslie
brent
and
postdoctoral
fellow
rupert
billingham.
his
research
became
more
focused
in

when
australian
biologist
frank
macfarlane
burnet
,
at
the
walter
and
eliza
hall
institute
of
medical

,
advanced
the
hypothesis
that
during

immediately
after

,
cells
gradually
acquire
the
ability
to
distinguish
between
their
own
tissue
substances
on

hand
and
unwanted
cells
and
foreign
material
on
the
other.with
billingham
,
he
published
a
seminal
paper
in

on
grafting
technique.
santa
j.
ono
,
the
american
immunologist
,
has
described
the
enduring
impact
of
this
paper
to
modern
science.
based
on
this
technique
of
grafting
,
medawar
's
team
devised
a
method
to
test
burnet
's
hypothesis.
they
extracted
cells
from
young
mouse
embryos
and
injected
them
into
another
mouse
of
different
strains.
when
the
mouse
developed
into
adult
and
skin
grafting
from
that
of
the
original
strain
was
performed
,
there
was
no
tissue
rejection.
meaning
that
the
mouse
had
tolerated
the
foreign
tissue
,
which
would
normally
be
rejected.
their
experimental
proof
of
burnet
's
hypothesis
was
first
published
in
a
brief
article
in
nature
in

research
outcomes
====
medawar
was
awarded
his
nobel
prize
in
<year>
with
burnet
for
their
work
in
tissue
grafting
which
is
the
basis
of
organ
transplants
,
and
their
discovery
of
acquired
immunological
tolerance.
this
work
was
used
in
dealing
with
skin
grafts
required
after
burns.
medawar
's
work
resulted
in
a
shift
of
emphasis
in
the
science
of
immunology
from
one
that
attempts
to
deal
with
the
fully
developed
immunity
mechanism
to
one
that
attempts
to
alter
the
immunity
mechanism
itself
,
as
in
the
attempt
to
suppress
the
body
's
rejection
of
organ
transplants.
it
directly
laid
the
foundation
for
the
first
successful
organ
transplantation
in
humans
,
specifically
kidney
transplantation
,
carried
out
by
an
american

===
theory
of
senescence
===
medawar
's
<year>
lecture
an
unsolved
problem
of
biology
(
published
<year>
)
addressed
ageing
and
senescence
,
and
he
begins
by
defining
both
terms
as
follows
:
we
obviously
need
a
word
for
mere
ageing
,
and
i
propose
to
use
'ageing
'
itself
for
just
that
purpose.
'ageing
'
hereafter
stands
for
mere
ageing
,
and
has
no
other
innuendo.
i
shall
use
the
word
'senescence
'
to
mean
ageing
accompanied
by
that
decline
of
bodily
faculties
and
sensibilities
and
energies
which
ageing
colloquially
entails.
he
then
tackles
the
question
of
why
evolution
has
permitted
organisms
to
senesce
,
even
though
(
<integer>
)
senescence
lowers
individual
fitness
,
and
(
<integer>
)
there
is
no
obvious
necessity
for
senescence.
in
answering
this
question
,
medawar
provides
two
fundamental
and
interrelated
insights.
first
,
there
is
an
inexorable
decline
in
probability
of
an
organism
's
existence
,
and
,
therefore
,
in
what
he
terms
``
reproductive
value.
''
he
suggests
that
it
therefore
follows
that
the
force
of
natural
selection
weakens
progressively
with
age
late
in
life
(
because
the
fecundity
of
younger
age-groups
is
overwhelmingly
more
significant
in
producing
the
next
generation
)
.
what
happens
to
an
organism
after
reproduction
is
only
weakly
reflected
in
natural
selection
by
the
effect
on
its
younger
relatives.
he
pointed
out
that
likelihood
of
death
at
various
times
of
life
,
as
judged
by
life
tables
,
was
an
indirect
measure
of
fitness
,
that
is
,
the
capacity
of
an
organism
to
propagate
its
genes.
life
tables
for
humans
show
,
for
example
that
the
lowest
likelihood
of
death
in
human
females
comes
at
about
age
<integer>
,
which
in
primitive
societies
would
likely
be
an
age
of
peak
reproduction.
this
has
served
as
the
basis
for
all
three
modern
theories
for
the
evolution
of
senescence.
===
theory
on
endocrine
evolution
===
medawar
presented
a
talk
on
viviparity
in
animals
(
the
phenomenon
by
which
some
animals
give
live
birth
)
at
a
meeting
on
evolution
at
oxford
in
july
<year>.
later
published
in
<year>
,
he
introduced
an
aphorism
:
endocrine
evolution
is
not
an
evolution
of
hormones
but
an
evolution
of
the
uses
to
which
they
are
put
;
an
evolution
not
,
to
put
it
crudely
,
of
chemical
formulae
but
of
reactivities
,
reaction
patterns
and
tissue
competences.the
notion
that
evolution
and
diversity
of
endocrine
function
in
animals
are
due
to
different
uses
of
each
hormone
rather
than
different
hormones
themselves
became
an
established
fact.
the
paper
is
also
regarded
as
a
pioneer
in
the
field
of
reproductive
immunology.
==
personal
life

medawar
never
knew
the
exact
meaning
of
his
surname
,
an
arabic
word
,
he
was
told
,
for
``
to
make
round
''
;
but
which
a
friend
explained
to
him
as
``
little
round
fat
man
''
.medawar
married
jean
shinglewood
taylor
on
<day>.
they
met
while
in
graduate
class
at
oxford
,
he
at
magdalene
and
taylor
at
somerville
college.
taylor
approached
him
for
the
meaning
of
``
heuristic
''
,
which
she
had
to
ask
twice
,
and
he
had
to
finally
offer
lessons
in
philosophy.
medawar
described
her
as
``
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
oxford
''
;
but
taylor
's
impression
was
he
looked
``
mildly
diabolical.
''
taylor
's
family
objected
to
their
marriage
as
medawar
had
``
no
background
,
and
no
money.
''
her
mother
was
explicitly
afraid
of
having
``
black
''
grandchildren
;
her
aunt
disinherited
her.
the
couple
had
two
sons
,
charles
and
alexander
,
and
two
daughters
,
caroline
and
louise.
medawar
was
interested
in
a
wide
range
of
subjects
including
opera
,
philosophy
and
cricket.
he
was
exceptionally
tall
,
<integer>
ft
and
<integer>
inches
,
physically
robust
,
with
a
big
voice
noted
particularly
during
his
lectures.
he
was
renowned
for
wit
and
humour
,
which
he
claimed
he
inherited
from
his
``
raucous
''
mother.
as
he
completed
his
phd
research
in
<year>
,
he
did
not
receive
the
degree
as
he
could
not
afford
the
requisite
£<integer>
,
to
which
he
commented
:
i
'm
an
impostor.
i
am

could
have

anyway
it
was
unfashionable
in
my
day.
john
young
[
probably
referring
to
john
zachary
young
]
was
not
a
phd
either.
a
phd
was
regarded
then
as
a
newfangled
german
importation
,
as
bizarre
and
undesirable
as
having
german
bands
playing
on
streetcorners.
''
he
was
regarded
as
the
philosopher
karl
popper

best-known
disciple
in

was
the
maternal
grandfather
of
the
screenwriter
and
director
alex
garland.
===
views
on
religion
===
medawar
declared
:
...
i
believe
that
a
reasonable
case
can
be
made
for
saying
,
not
that
we
believe
in
god
because
he
exists
but
rather
that
he
exists
because
we
believe
in
him
...
considered
as
an
element
of
the
world
,
god
has
the
same
degree
and
kind
of
objective
reality
as
do
other
products
of
mind
...
i
regret
my
disbelief
in
god
and
religious
answers
generally
,
for
i
believe
it
would
give
satisfaction
and
comfort
to
many
in
need
of
it
if
it
were
possible
to
discover
and
propound
good
scientific
and
philosophic
reasons
to
believe
in
god
...
to
abdicate
from
the
rule
of
reason
and
substitute
for
it
an
authentication
of
belief
by
the
intentness
and
degree
of
conviction
with
which
we
hold
it
can
be
perilous
and
destructive
...
i
am
a
rationalist—something
of
a
period
piece
nowadays
,
i
admit
...
although
he
normally
sympathised
with
christianity
especially
on
moral
teachings
,
he
found
the
biblical
stories
unethical
and
was
``
shocked
by
the
way
in
which
[
biblical
]
characters
deceived
and
defrauded
each
other.
''
he
even
asked
his
wife
``
to
make
sure
that
such
a
book
did
not
fall
into
the
hands
of
[
their
]
children.
''
nonetheless
,
he
also
said
the
following
,
which
suggests
that
although
religion
has
good
value
for
humans
in
aggregate
,
it
does
not
help
them
all
equally
:
religion
has
not
sustained
me
on
any
of
the
occasions
when
the
comfort
it
professes
would
have
been
most
welcome.
==
later
life
and
death
==
in
<year>
medawar
was
invited
by
the
bbc

present
the
broadcaster

reith
lectures—following
in
the
footsteps
of
his
colleague
,
j.

for
his
own

of
six
radio
broadcasts
,
titled

medawar
examined
how
the
human
race
might
continue
to
evolve.
while
attending
the
annual
british
association
meeting
in

,
medawar
suffered
a
stroke
when
reading
the
lesson
at
exeter
cathedral
,
a
duty
which
falls
on
every
new
president
of

it
was
,
as
he
said
,
``
monstrous
bad

vickrey
(
<day>
–
<day>
)
was
a
canadian-american
professor
of
economics
and
nobel
laureate.
vickrey
was
awarded
the
<year>
nobel
memorial
prize
in
economic
sciences
with
james
mirrlees
for
their
research
into
the
economic
theory
of
incentives
under

information
,
becoming
the
only
nobel
laureate
born
in
british
columbia.
the
announcement
of
his
nobel
prize
was
made
just
three
days
prior
to
his
death.
vickrey
died
while
traveling
to
a
conference
of
georgist
academics
that
he
helped
found
and
never
missed
once
in
<integer>
years.
his
columbia
university
economics
department
colleague
c.
lowell
harriss
accepted
the
posthumous
prize
on
his
behalf.
there
are
only
three
other
cases
where
a
nobel
prize
has
been
presented
posthumously.
==
early
years
==
vickrey
was
born
in
victoria
,
british
columbia
and
attended
high
school
at
phillips
academy
in
andover
,
massachusetts.
after
obtaining
his
b.s.
in
mathematics
at
yale
university
in
<year>
,
he
went
on
to
complete
his
m.a.
in
<year>
and
ph.d.
in
<year>
at
columbia
university
,
where
he
remained
for
most
of
his
career.
==
career
==
vickrey
was
the
first
to
use
the
tools
of
game
theory
to
explain
the
dynamics
of
auctions.
in
his
seminal
paper
,
vickrey
derived
several
auction
equilibria
,
and
provided
an
early
revenue-equivalence
result.
the
revenue
equivalence
theorem
remains
the
centrepiece
of
modern
auction
theory.
the
vickrey
auction
is
named
after
him.vickrey
worked
on
congestion
pricing
,
the
notion
that
roads
and
other
services
should
be
priced
so
that
users
see
the
costs
that
arise
from
the
service
being
fully
used
when
there
is
still
demand.
congestion
pricing
gives
a
signal
to
users
to
adjust
their
behavior
or
to
investors
to
expand
the
service
in
order
to
remove
the
constraint.
the
theory
was
later
partially
put
into
action
in
london.
in
public
economics
,
vickrey
extended
the
georgist
marginal
cost
pricing
approach
of
harold
hotelling
and
showed
how
public
goods
should
be
provided
at
marginal
cost
and
capital
investment
outlays
financed
with
land
value
tax.
vickrey
wrote
that
replacing
taxes
on
production
and
labor
(
``
including
property
taxes
on
improvements
''
)
with
fees
for
holding
valuable
land
sites
``
would
substantially
improve
the
economic
efficiency
of
the
jurisdiction
''
.
vickrey
further
argued
that
land
value
tax
had
no
adverse
effects
and
that
replacing
existing
taxes
in
this
way
would
increase
local
productivity
enough
that
land
prices
would
rise
instead
of
fall.
he
also
made
an
ethical
argument
for
georgist
value
capture
,
noting
that
owners
of
valuable
locations
still
take
(
exclude
others
from
)
local
public
goods
,
even
if
they
choose
not
to
use
them
,
so
without
land
value
tax
,
land
users
have
to
pay
twice
for
those
public
services
(
once
in
tax
to
government
and
once
in
rent
to
holders
of
land
title
)
.vickrey
's
economic
philosophy
was
influenced
by
john
maynard
keynes
and
henry
george.
he
was
sharply
critical
of
the
chicago
school
of
economics
and
was
vocal
in
opposing
the
political
focus
on
achieving
balanced
budgets
and
fighting
inflation
,
especially
in
times
of
high
unemployment.
working
under
general
macarthur
,
vickrey
helped
accomplish
radical
land
reform
in
japan.vickrey
had
many
graduate
students
and
protegés
at

)
was
an
american
economist
,
and
the
co-author
of

modigliani–miller
theorem
(
<year>
)
,
which
proposed
the
irrelevance

along

biography
==
===
early
years
===
miller
was
born
in
boston
,
massachusetts
to
jewish
parents
sylvia
and
joel
miller
,
a
housewife
and
attorney.
he
attended
harvard
university
as
an
undergraduate
student.
he
worked
during
world
war
ii
as
an
economist
in
the
division
of
tax
research
of
the
treasury
department
,
and
received
a
ph.d.
in
economics
from
johns
hopkins
university
,
<year>.
his
first
academic
appointment
after
receiving
his
doctorate
was
visiting
assistant
lecturer
at
the
london
school
of
economics.
===
career
===
in
<year>
,
at
carnegie
institute
of
technology
(
now
carnegie
mellon
university
)
,
he
collaborated
with
his
colleague
franco
modigliani
on
the
paper
the
cost
of
capital
,
corporate
finance
and
the
theory
of
investment.
this
paper
urged
a
fundamental
objection
to
the
traditional
view
of
corporate
finance
,
according
to
which
a
corporation
can
reduce
its
cost
of
capital
by
finding
the
right
debt-to-equity
ratio.
according
to
the
modigliani–miller
theorem
,
on
the
other
hand
,
there
is
no
right
ratio
,
so
corporate
managers
should
seek
to
minimize
tax
liability
and
maximize
corporate
net
wealth
,
letting
the
debt
ratio
chips
fall
where
they
will.
the
way
in
which
they
arrived
at
this
conclusion
made
use
of
the
``
no
arbitrage
''
argument
,
i.e.
the
premise
that
any
state
of
affairs
that
will
allow
traders
of
any
market
instrument
to
create
a
riskless
money
machine
will
almost
immediately
disappear.
they
set
the
pattern
for
many
arguments
based
on
that
premise
in
subsequent
years.
miller
wrote
or
co-authored
eight
books.
he
became

,
although
he
continued
teaching
at

more
years.
his
works
formed
the
basis
of
the
``
modigliani-miller
financial
theory
''
.
he
served
as
a
public
director
on

<integer>
billion
in
trading
losses
by
what
was
characterized
as
a
rogue
futures
trader
at
a

the
wall
street
journal
that
management
of
the

was
to
blame
for
panicking
and
liquidating
the
position
too
early.

,
the
two
economists
had
not
collaborated
but
had
come
to
similar
conclusions
separately.
singer
's
supporters
are
quick
to
point
out
that
it
appears
that
singer
wrote
down
the
thesis
before
the
more
well-known
prebisch.
the
fundamental
claim
of
the
hypothesis
is
that
in
a
world
system
in
which
poorer
nations
specialise
in
primary
products
such
as
raw
minerals
and
agricultural
products
that
are
then
shipped
to
industrialised
nations
that
,
in
turn
,
make
advanced
products
to
be
sold
to
poorer
nations
,
all
of
the
benefits
of
international
trade
go
to
the
wealthy
nations.
as
a
result
,
singer
was
a
passionate
advocate
for
increased
foreign
aid
in
a
variety
of
forms
to
the
developing
world
to
offset
the
disproportionate
gain
to
developed
nations
of
trade.
he
attempted
to
create
a
``
soft-loan
''
fund
to
offer
loans
at
interest
rates
below
market
rates
to
be
administered
by
the
united
nations
,
but
it
was
systematically
blocked
by
the
united
states
and
the
united
kingdom
,
which
wished
to
retain
control
of
money
flowing
out
of
the

he
was
thus
considered
``

economist
sir
alec
cairncross
has
said
of
singer
,
``
there
are
few
of
the
developing
countries
that
he
has
not
visited
and
still
fewer
that
he
has
not
advised.
he
must
have
addressed
a
wider
variety
of
academics

a
wider
variety
of
places
about
a
wider
variety
of
subjects
than
any

close
adviser
to

and
advocated
the
use
of

during

kennedy

mcnamara
instituted
a

,
which
anticipated
the

,
the
number
of

mcnamara
and

feared

tex
thornton

had
served
,
put
together
a
group
of
former
officers
from
the
office
of
statistical
control
to
go
into
business
together.
thornton
had
seen
an
article
in

portraying
ford
as
being
in
dire
need
of
reform.
henry

because
of

combined
with
asking

ford

initially
and
disparagingly
referred

rebranded
themselves
as
the
``

starting
as
manager
of
planning
and
financial
analysis
,
mcnamara
advanced
rapidly
through
a
series
of
top-level
management
positions.
mcnamara
had
ford
adopt
computers
to
construct
models
to
find
the
most
efficient
,
rational
means
of
production
,
which
led
to
much
rationalization.
mcnamara

``
scientific

with
his
use

computer

graphs
showing

regarded
as
extremely
innovative
in

<year>s
and
were
much
copied
by
other
executives
in
the
following

in
his
<year>
memoirs
,
mcnamara
wrote
:
``
i
had
spent
fifteen
years
as
a

identifying

forcing
organizations—often
against

think
deeply

realistically
about

he
was

simple

inexpensive-to-produce
counter
to
the

prominent
in

mcnamara
placed
a
high
emphasis
on
safety
:
the
lifeguard
options
package
introduced
the
seat
belt
(
a
novelty
at
the

and
a

and

mcnamara
pushed
for
smaller
versions
,
such
as
the

on
november
<integer>
,
<year>
,
mcnamara
became
the
first
president

in

==
secretary

after
his
election
in
<year>
,
president-elect
john
f.
kennedy
first
offered
the
post
of
secretary
of
defense
to
robert
a.
lovett
,
who
had
already
served
in
that
position
in
the
truman
administration
;
lovett
declined
but
recommended
mcnamara.
kennedy
had
read
about
mcnamara
and
his
career
in
a
time
magazine
article
on
december
<integer>
,
<year>
,
and
interviewed
him
on
december
<integer>
,
with
his
brother
and
right-hand
man
robert
f.
kennedy
also
being
present.
mcnamara
told
kennedy
that
he
did
n't
know
anything
about
government
,
to
which
kennedy
replied
:
``
we
can
learn
our
jobs
together.
i
do
n't
know
how
to
be
president
either
''
.
mcnamara
had
read
kennedy
's
ghostwritten
book
profiles
in
courage
and
asked
him
if
he
had
really
written
it
himself
,
with
kennedy
insisting
that
he
did.
mcnamara
's
confidence
and
self-assurance
impressed
kennedy.
kennedy
offered
mcnamara
the
chance
to
be
either
secretary
of
defense
or
secretary
of
the
treasury
;
mcnamara
came
back
a
week
later
,
accepting
the
post
of
secretary
of
defense
on
the
condition
of
having
the
right
of
final
approval
in
all
appointments
to
the
department
of
defense
,
with
kennedy
replying
:
``
it
's
a
deal
''
.
mcnamara
's
salary
as
the
ceo
of
ford
ran
to
some
$
<integer>
million
dollars
per
year
while
by
contrast
the
position
of
the
defense
secretary
paid
only
$
<integer>
,
<integer>
per
year.
given
the
financial
sacrifices
,
mcnamara
was
able
to
insist
to
kennedy
that
he
have
the
right
to
appoint
his
officials
and
run
the
pentagon
his
own
way.
according
to
special
counsel
ted
sorensen
,
kennedy
regarded
mcnamara
as
the
``
star
of
his
team
,
calling
upon
him
for
advice
on
a
wide
range
of
issues
beyond
national
security
,
including
business
and
economic
matters.
''
mcnamara
became
one
of
the
few
members
of
the
kennedy
administration
to
work
and
socialize
with
kennedy
,
and
he
became
close
to
attorney
general
robert
f.
kennedy
,
eventually
serving
as
a
pallbearer
at
the
younger
kennedy
's
funeral
in
<year>.
initially
,
the
basic
policies
outlined
by
president
kennedy
in
a
message
to
congress
on
march
<integer>
,
<year>
,
guided
mcnamara
in
the
reorientation
of
the
defense
program.
kennedy
rejected
the
concept
of
first-strike
attack
and
emphasized
the
need
for
adequate
strategic
arms
and
defense
to
deter
nuclear
attack
on
the
united
states
and
its
allies.
u.s.
arms
,
he
maintained
,
must
constantly
be
under
civilian
command
and
control
,
and
the
nation
's
defense
posture
had
to
be
``
designed
to
reduce
the
danger
of
irrational
or
unpremeditated
general
war.
''
the
primary
mission
of
u.s.
overseas
forces
,
in
cooperation
with
its
allies
,
was
``
to
prevent
the
steady
erosion
of
the
free
world
through
limited
wars
''
.
kennedy
and
mcnamara
rejected
massive
retaliation
for
a
posture
of
flexible
response.
the
u.s.
wanted
choices
in
an
emergency
other
than
``
inglorious
retreat
or
unlimited
retaliation
''
,
as
the
president
put
it.
out
of
a
major
review
of
the
military
challenges
confronting
the
u.s.
initiated
by
mcnamara
in
<year>
came
a
decision
to
increase
the
nation
's
``
limited
warfare
''
capabilities.
these
moves
were
significant
because
mcnamara
was
abandoning
president
dwight
d.
eisenhower
's
policy
of
massive
retaliation
in
favor
of
a
flexible
response
strategy
that
relied
on
increased
u.s.
capacity
to
conduct
limited
,
non-nuclear
warfare.
the
kennedy
administration
placed
particular
emphasis
on
improving
the
ability
to
counter
communist
``
wars
of
national
liberation
''
,
in
which
the
enemy
avoided
head-on
military
confrontation
and
resorted
to
political
subversion
and
guerrilla
tactics.
as
mcnamara
said
in
his
<year>
annual
report
,
``
the
military
tactics
are
those
of
the
sniper
,
the
ambush
,
and
the
raid.
the
political
tactics
are
terror
,
extortion
,
and
assassination.
''
in
practical
terms
,
this
meant
training
and
equipping
u.s.
military
personnel
,
as
well
as
allies
such
as
south
vietnam
,
for
counterinsurgency
operations.
during
the
cuban
missile
crisis
in
october
<year>
,
mcnamara
served
as
a
member
of
excomm
and
played
a
large
role
in
the
administration
's
handling
and
eventual
defusing
of
the
cuban
missile
crisis.
he
was
a
strong
proponent
of
the
blockade
option
over
a
missile
strike
and
helped
persuade
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
to
agree
with
the
blockade
option.

in

he
called
up
reserves

also
proceeded
to
expand
the
regular

kennedy
,
who
was
fascinated
with
counterinsurgency
warfare
,
made
a
major
push
to
develop
the
special
forces
,
popularly
known
as
the
green
berets.
the
u.s.
army
leadership
was
,
for
the
most
part
,
strongly
opposed
to
the
counterinsurgency
vogue
,
and
stoutly
resisted
the
presidential
pressure
for
more
counterinsurgency
training
and
forces.
the
u.s.
army
,
for
reasons
of
bureaucratic
politics
,
budgetary
reasons
and
sheer
pride
,
wanted
to
be
equipped
to
fight
a
conventional
war
in
central
europe
against
the
soviet
army
,
with
a
large
number
of
divisions
armed
with
expensive
hi-tech
weapons
designed
for
maximum
firepower
,
instead
of
having
small
teams
of
special
forces
armed
with
relatively
low
tech
weapons
like
assault
rifles
fight
in
a
third
world
country.
===
nuclear
strategy
,
the
triad
doctrine
===
when
mcnamara
took
over
the
pentagon
in
<year>
,
the
united
states
military
relied
on
an
all-out
nuclear
strike
to
respond
to
a
soviet
attack
of
any
kind
,
which
would
kill
soviet
military
forces
and
civilians.
this
was
the
same
nuclear
strategy
planned
by
the
strategic
air
command
(
sac
)
,
led
by
general
curtis
lemay.
mcnamara
did
not
agree
with
this
approach.
he
sought
other
options
after
seeing
that
this
strategy
could
not
guarantee
the
destruction
of
all
soviet
nuclear
weapons
,
thus
leaving
the
united
states
vulnerable
to
retaliation.
mcnamara
's
alternative
in
the
doctrine
of
counterforce
was
to
try
to
limit
the
united
states
nuclear
exchange
by
targeting
only
enemy
military
forces.
this
would
prevent
retaliation
and
escalation
by
holding
soviet
cities
hostage
to
a
follow-up
strike.
mcnamara
later
concluded
that
counterforce
was
not
likely
to
control
escalation
but
to
provoke
retaliation.
the
u.s.
nuclear
policy
remained
the
same.

mcnamara
also
increased
long-range
airlift

funds
for

development.
after
reviewing
the
separate
and
often
uncoordinated
service
efforts
in
intelligence
and
communications
,
mcnamara
in
<year>
consolidated
these
functions
in
the
defense
intelligence
agency
and
the
defense
communications
agency
(
the
latter
originally
established
by
sod

in

)
,
having

report

the
end
effect
was
to
remove
the
intelligence
function
from

control

to
put
it
under

mcnamara
's
institution
of
systems
analysis
as
a
basis
for
making
key
decisions
on
force
requirements
,
weapon
systems
,
and
other
matters
occasioned
much
debate.
two
of
its
main
practitioners
during
the
mcnamara
era
,
alain
c.
enthoven
and
k.
wayne
smith
,
described
the
concept
as
follows
:
``
first
,
the
word
'systems
'
indicates
that
every
decision
should
be
considered
in
as
broad
a
context
as
necessary
...
the
word
'analysis
'
emphasizes
the
need
to
reduce
a
complex
problem
to
its
component
parts
for
better
understanding.
systems
analysis
takes
a
complex
problem
and
sorts
out
the
tangle
of
significant
factors
so
that
each
can
be
studied
by
the
method
most
appropriate
to
it.
''
enthoven
and
smith
said
they
used
mainly
civilians
as
systems
analysts
because
they
could
apply
independent
points
of
view
to
force
planning.
mcnamara
's
tendency
to
take
military
advice
into
less
account
than
had
previous
secretaries
and
to
override
military
opinions
contributed
to
his
unpopularity
with
service
leaders.
it
was
also
generally
thought
that
systems
analysis
,
rather
than
being
objective
,
was
tailored
by
the
civilians
to
support
decisions
that
mcnamara
had
already
made.
the
most
notable
example
of
systems
analysis
was
the
planning
,
programming
and
budgeting
system
(
ppbs
)
instituted
by
united
states
department
of
defense
comptroller
charles
j.
hitch.
mcnamara
directed
hitch
to
analyze
defense
requirements
systematically
and
produce
a
long-term
,
program-oriented
defense
budget.
ppbs
evolved
to
become
the
heart
of
the
mcnamara
management
program.
according
to
enthoven
and
smith
,
the
basic
ideas
of
ppbs
were
:
``
the
attempt
to
put
defense
program
issues
into
a
broader
context
and
to
search
for
explicit
measures
of
national
need
and
adequacy
''
;
``
consideration
of
military
needs
and
costs
together
''
;
``
explicit
consideration
of
alternatives
at
the
top
decision
level
''
;
``
the
active
use
of
an
analytical
staff
at
the
top
policymaking
levels
''
;
``
a
plan
combining
both
forces
and
costs
which
projected
into
the
future
the
foreseeable
implications
of
current
decisions
''
;
and
``
open
and
explicit
analysis
,
that
is
,
each
analysis
should
be
made
available
to
all
interested
parties
,
so
that
they
can
examine
the
calculations
,
data
,
and
assumptions
and
retrace
the
steps
leading
to
the
conclusions.
''
in
practice
,
the
data
produced
by
the
analysis
was
so
large
and
so
complex
that
while
it
was
available
to
all
interested
parties
,
none
of
them
could
challenge
the
conclusions.among
the
management
tools
developed
to
implement
ppbs
were
the
five
year
defense
plan
(
fydp
)
,
the
draft
presidential
memorandum
(
dpm
)
,
the
readiness
,
information
and
control
tables
,
and
the
development
concept
paper
(
dcp
)
.
the
annual
fydp
was
a
series
of
tables
projecting
forces
for
eight
years
and
costs
and
manpower
for
five
years
in
mission-oriented
,
rather
than
individual
service
,
programs.
by
<year>
,
the
fydp
covered
ten
military
areas
:
strategic
forces
,
general-purpose
forces
,
intelligence
and
communications
,
airlift
and
sealift
,
guard
and
reserve
forces
,
research

,
central
supply
and
maintenance
,
training
and
medical
services
,
administration
and
related
activities
,
and
support
of
other
nations.
the
draft
presidential
memorandum
(
dpm
)
—intended
for
the
white
house
and
usually
prepared
by
the
systems
analysis
office—was
a
method
to
study
and
analyze
major
defense
issues.
sixteen
dpms
appeared
between
<year>
and
<year>
on
such
topics
as
strategic
offensive
and
defensive
forces
,
nato
strategy
and
force
structure
,
military
assistance
,
and
tactical
air
forces.
osd
sent
the
dpms
to
the
services
and
the
joint
chief
of
staff
(
jcs
)
for
comment
;
in
making
decisions
,
mcnamara
included
in
the
dpm
a
statement
of
alternative
approaches
,
force
levels
,
and
other
factors.
the
dpm
in
its
final
form
became
a
decision
document.
the
dpm
was
hated
by
the
jcs
and
uniformed
military
in
that
it
cut
their
ability
to
communicate
directly
to
the
white
house.
the
dpms
were
also
disliked
because
the
systems
analysis
process
was
so
heavyweight
that
it
was
impossible
for
any
service
to
effectively
challenge
its
conclusions.the
development
concept
paper
examined
performance
,
schedule
,
cost
estimates
,
and
technical
risks
to
provide
a
basis
for
determining
whether
to
begin
or
continue
a
research
and
development
program.
but
in
practice
,
what
it
proved
to
be
was
a
cost
burden
that
became
a
barrier
to
entry
for
companies
attempting
to
deal
with
the
military.
it
aided
the
trend
toward
a
few
large
non-competitive
defense
contractors
serving
the
military.
rather
than
serving
any
useful
purpose
,
the
overhead
necessary
to
generate
information
that
was
often
in
practice
ignored
resulted
in
increased
costs
throughout
the
system.the
readiness
,
information
,
and
control
tables
provided
data
on
specific
projects
,
more
detailed
than
in
the
fydp
,
such
as
the
tables
for
the
southeast
asia
deployment
plan
,
which
recorded
by
month
and
quarter
the
schedule
for
deployment
,
consumption
rates
,
and
future
projections
of
u.s.
forces
in

===
cuban
missile
crisis
===
the
cuban
missile
crisis
was
between
the
united
states
and
the
soviet
union
lasting
for
<integer>
days
in
october
<year>.
during
this
time
,
robert
mcnamara
was
serving
as
secretary
of
defense
and
one
of
john
f.
kennedy
's
trusted
advisors.
when
kennedy
received
confirmation
of
the
placement
of
offensive
soviet
missiles
in
cuba
,
he
immediately
set
up
'executive
committee
'
,
referred
to
as
'excomm'.
this
committee
included
united
states
government
officials
,
including
robert
mcnamara
,
to
advise
kennedy
on
the
crisis.
kennedy
instructed
excomm
to
immediately
come
up
with
a
response
to
the
soviet
threat
unanimously
without
him
present.
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
favored
launching
air
strikes
against
the
soviet
missile
sites
in
cuba
,
an
opinion
that
mcnamara
did
not
hold
and
advised
kennedy
against
the
chiefs
,
warning
that
air
strikes
would
almost
certainly
be
crossing
the
rubicon.
mcnamara
's
relations
with
the
hawkish
joint
chiefs
of
staff
had
been
strained
during
the
crisis
,
and
his
relations
with
admiral
george
anderson
and
general
curtis
lemay
were
especially
testy.
both
admiral
anderson
and
general
lemay
had
favored
invading
cuba
,
welcomed
the
prospect
of
a
war
with
soviet
union
under
the
grounds
that
a
war
with
the
soviet
union
was
inevitable
,
and
whose
attitudes
towards
kennedy
and
mcnamara
had
verged
on
insubordination.
admiral
anderson
had
at
a
one
point
ordered
mcnamara
out
of
the
naval
operations
room
,
saying
that
as
a
civilian
he
was
unqualified
to
be
making
decisions
about
naval
matters
,
leading
mcnamara
to
say
that
he
was
the
defense
secretary
and
anderson
was
unqualified
to
be
ordering
him
to
do
anything.
during
this
time
it
was
confirmed
the
crisis
had
to
be
resolved
within
<integer>
hours
by
receiving
two
messages
from
nikita
khrushchev.
the
first
message
,
an
informal
one
,
stated
if
the
united
states
guaranteed
to
not
invade
cuba
then
they
would
take
the
missiles
out.
the
second
message
,
a
more
formal
one
,
was
broadcast
on
the
radio
stating
if
the
united
states
attacked
then
cuba
was
prepared
to
retaliate
with
masses
of
military
power.
although
american
defense
planning
focused
on
using
nuclear
weapons
,
kennedy
and
mcnamara
saw
it
was
clear
the
use
of
strategic
weapons
could
be
suicidal.
on
<day>
october
<integer>
,
excomm
had
their
first
meeting.
the
majority
of
officials
favored
an
air
attack
on
cuba
in
hopes
to
destroy
the
missile
sites
,
although
the
vote
was
not
unanimous
which
brought
them
to
other
alternatives.
by
the
end
of
the
week
,
excomm
came
up
with
four
different
alternative
strategies
to
present
to
the
president
:
a
blockade
,
an
air
strike
,
an
invasion
,
or
some
combination
of
these.
these
actions
are
known
as
oplan
<integer>
,
oplan
<integer>
and
oplan
<integer>.
a
quarantine
was
a
way
to
prevent
the
soviets
from
bringing
any
military
equipment
in
or
out
of
cuba.
during
the
final
review
of
both
alternatives
on
<day>
,
october
<integer>
,
upon
kennedy
's
request
,
mcnamara
presented
the
argument
against
the
attack
and
for
the
quarantine.
on
<day>
,
october
<integer>
at
<integer>
:
<integer>
a.m.
edt
,
the
quarantine
line
around
cuba
went
into
effect.
following
cuba
's
aftermath
,
mcnamara
stated
,
``
there
is
no
such
thing
as
strategy
,
only
crisis
management.
''
after
the
crisis
mcnamara
recommended
to
kennedy
that
admiral
anderson
and
general
lemay
be
sacked.
however
,
kennedy
was
afraid
of
a
congressional
backlash
if
he
sacked
two
of
the
chiefs
at
once.
moreover
,
kennedy
did
not
wish
for
his
disagreements
with
the
joint
chiefs
to
become
public
and
felt
that
sacking
two
of
the
chiefs
at
once
would
lead
to
speculation
in
the
media
about
such
a
disagreement.
kennedy
told
mcnamara
:
``
all
right
,
you
can
fire
one.
which
one
will
it
be
?
''
without
hesitation
,
mcnamara
answered
``
anderson
''
.
later
on
in
<year>
,
a
white
house
release
announced
that
admiral
anderson
was
the
new
american
ambassador
to
portugal.
===
cost
reductions
===
mcnamara
's
staff
stressed
systems
analysis
as
an
aid
in
decision
making
on
weapon
development
and
many
other
budget
issues.
the
secretary
believed
that
the
united
states
could
afford
any
amount
needed
for
national
security
,
but
that
``
this
ability
does
not
excuse
us
from
applying
strict
standards
of
effectiveness
and
efficiency
to
the
way
we
spend
our
defense
dollars
...
.
you
have
to
make
a
judgment
on
how
much
is
enough.
''
acting
on
these
principles
,
mcnamara
instituted
a
much-publicized
cost
reduction
program
,
which
,
he
reported
,
saved
$
<integer>
billion
in
the
five-year
period
beginning
in
<year>.
although
he
had
to
withstand
a
storm
of
criticism
from
senators
and
representatives
from
affected
congressional
districts
,
he
closed
many
military
bases
and
installations
that
he
judged
unnecessary
for
national
security.
he
was
equally
determined
about
other
cost-saving
measures.due
to
the
nuclear
arms
race
,
the
vietnam
war
buildup
and
other
projects
,
total
obligational
authority
(
toa
)
increased
greatly
during
the
mcnamara
years.

from

,
mcnamara
's
last

(
though
he
left

in

.
not
until
fy
<year>
did
dod
's
total

surpass
that
of
fy

in
constant

====
program
consolidation
====
one
major
hallmark
of
mcnamara
's
cost
reductions
was
the
consolidation
of
programs
from
different
services
,
most
visibly
in
aircraft
acquisition
,
believing
that
the
redundancy
created
waste
and
unnecessary
spending.
mcnamara
directed
the
air
force
to
adopt
the
navy
's
f<integer>
phantom
and
a<integer>
corsair
combat
aircraft
,
a
consolidation
that
was
quite
successful.
conversely
,
his
actions
in
mandating
a
premature
across-the-board
adoption
of
the
untested
m16
rifle
proved
catastrophic
when
the
weapons
began
to
fail
in
combat
,
though
later
congressional
investigations
revealed
the
causes
of
these
failures
as
negligence
and
borderline
sabotage
on
behalf
of
the
army
ordnance
corps
'
officers.
mcnamara
tried
to
extend
his
success
by
merging
development
programs
as
well
,
resulting
in
the
tfx
dual
service
project
to
combine
navy
requirements
for
a
fleet
air
defense
(
fad
)
aircraft
and
air
force
requirements
for
a
tactical
bomber.
his
experience
in
the
corporate
world
led
him
to
believe
that
adopting
a
single
type
for
different
missions
and
service
would
save
money.
he
insisted
on
the
general
dynamics
entry
over
the
dod
's
preference
for
boeing
because
of
commonality
issues.
though
heralded
as
a
fighter
that
could
do
everything
(
fast
supersonic
dash
,
slow
carrier
and
short
airfield
landings
,
tactical
strike
and
even
close
air
support
)
,
in
the
end
it
involved
too
many
compromises
to
succeed
at
any
of
them.
the
navy
version
was
drastically
overweight
and
difficult
to
land
,
and
eventually
canceled
after
a
grumman
study
showed
it
was
incapable
of
matching
the
abilities
of
the
newly
revealed
soviet
mig<integer>
and
mig<integer>
aircraft.
the
f<integer>
would
eventually
find
its
niche
as
a
tactical
bomber
and
electronic
warfare
aircraft
with
the
air
force.however
,
many
analysts
believe
that
even
though
the
tfx
project
itself
was
a
failure
,
mcnamara
was
ahead
of
his
time
as
the
trend
in
fighter
design
has
continued
toward
consolidation
—
the
f<integer>
falcon
and
f/a<integer>
hornet
emerged
as
multi-role
fighters
,
and
most
modern
designs
combine
many
of
the
roles
the
tfx
would
have
had.
in
many
ways
,
the
joint
strike
fighter
is
seen
as
a
rebirth
of
the
tfx
project
,
in
that
it
purports
to
satisfy
the
needs
of
three
american
air
arms
(
as
well
as
several
foreign
customers
)
,
fulfilling
the
roles
of
strike
fighter
,
carrier-launched
fighter
,
v/stol
,
and
close
air
support
(
and
drawing
many
criticisms
similar
to
those
leveled
against
the
tfx
)

,
the
u.s.
military
advisory
group
in
south
vietnam
steadily
increased
,
with
mcnamara
's
concurrence
,
from
<integer>
to
<integer>
,
<integer>.
u.s.
involvement
escalated
after
the
gulf
of
tonkin
incidents
in
august
<year>
,
involving
two
purported
attacks
on
a
u.s.
navy
destroyer
by
north
vietnamese
naval
vessels.in
the
kennedy
administration
,
mcnamara
was
closely
allied
in
debates
in
the
cabinet
with
dean
rusk
,
the
secretary
of
state
,
with
both
favoring
greater
american
support
for
south
vietnam.
initially
,
the
main
concern
of
the
new
kennedy
administration
was
laos
,
not
south
vietnam.
in
february
<year>
,
mcnamara
spoke
in
favor
of
intervention
in
laos
,
saying
that
six
at<integer>
planes
owed
by
the
central
intelligence
agency
could
be
fitted
to
carry
<integer>-pound
bombs
in
support
of
general
phoumi
nosavan
's
forces.
rusk
shot
down
that
proposal
,
saying
his
world
war
two
experiences
in
burma
had
taught
him
that
bombing
was
ineffective
in
the
jungles
and
six
planes
were
not
enough.
in
the
spring
of
<year>
kennedy
seriously
considered
intervening
in
laos
where
the
communist
pathet
lao
,
supported
by
north
vietnam
,
were
winning
the
civil
war.
at
one
point
,
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
advised
sending
<integer>
,
<integer>
u.s.
troops
into
laos.
however
,
laos
was
a
backward
,
landlocked
country
with
barely
any
modern
roads
and
only
two
modern
airfields
,
both
of
which
were
quite
small
by
western
standards
,
which
would
have
made
for
a
logistical
nightmare.
furthermore
,
memories
of
the
korean
war
were
still
fresh
,
and
it
was
generally
accepted
if
the
united
states
sent
in
troops
into
laos
,
it
was
almost
certain
that
china
would
do
likewise
,
thus
leading
to
another
sino-american
war.
the
southeast
asia
treaty
organization
(
seato
)
was
split
with
its
european
members
such
as
france
and
britain
stoutly
opposed
to
intervention
in
laos
while
its
asian
members
such
as
thailand
and
the
philippines
were
all
for
intervention
in
laos.
mcnamara
noted
to
kennedy
it
was
quite
possible
that
the
two
airfields
in
laos
could
be
seized
by
the
communist
forces
,
which
would
cut
off
any
u.s
forces
in
laos
,
thus
turning
the
intervention
into
a
debacle.
at
a
meeting
on
<day>
,
when
questioned
by
the
attorney-general
,
robert
f.
kennedy
,
mcnamara
stated
that
``
we
should
take
a
stand
in
thailand
and
south
vietnam
''
,
pointedly
omitting
laos
from
the
nations
in
southeast
asia
to
risk
a
war
over.mcnamara
soon
changed
his
mind
about
laos.
on
<day>
,
he
advised
president
kennedy
to
send
in
ground
troops
into
laos
,
saying
``
we
must
be
prepared
to
win
''
,
and
advising
using
nuclear
weapons
if
china
should
intervene.
on
<integer>
may
,
mcnamara
,
using
more
stronger
language
,
told
kennedy
that
the
united
states
should
definitely
intervene
in
laos
,
even
through
he
was
very
certain
that
it
would
lead
to
chinese
intervention
,
concluding
that
``
at
some
point
,
we
may
have
to
initiate
the
use
of
nuclear
weapons
to
prevent
the
defeat
of
our
forces
''
.
kennedy
,
who
was
distrustful
of
the
hawkish
advice
given
by
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
after
the
failure
of
the
bay
of
pigs
invasion
,
instead
decided
to
seek
a
diplomatic
solution
to
the
laos
crisis
at
a
peace
conference
in
geneva
in
<year><integer>
that
ultimately
led
to
an
agreement
to
make
laos
neutral
in
the
cold
war.
the
problems
posed
by
the
possibility
of
a
war
with
china
and
the
logistical
problems
of
supporting
a
large
units
of
troops
in
laos
led
mcnamara
ultimately
favor
an
alternative
strategy
of
having
a
small
number
of
u.s
army
special
forces
operate
in
laos
working
with
american
allies
such
as
the
hmong
hill
tribes.
on
<day>
,
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
estimated
to
mcnamara
that
if
chinese
forces
entered
laos
,
then
the
seato
forces
would
need
at
least
<integer>
divisions
consisting
of
some
<integer>
,
<integer>
men
to
stop
them.
at
the
same
time
,
the
joint
chiefs
also
estimated
that
the
two
airfields
in
laos
were
capable
of
landing
some
<integer>
,
<integer>
troops
a
day
each
,
which
would
give
the
advantage
to
the
chinese.
such
dire
assessments
led
kennedy
to
ignore
mcnamara
and
the
joint
chiefs
,
and
to
favor
a
diplomatic
solution
the
laos
crisis.in
october
<year>
,
when
general
maxwell
taylor
and
walt
whitman
rostow
advised
sending
<integer>
,
<integer>
american
combat
troops
to
south
vietnam
,
mcnamara
rejected
that
recommendation
as
inadequate
,
stating
that
<integer>
,
<integer>
troops
would
``
probably
not
tip
the
scales
decisively
''
,
instead
recommending
to
kennedy
that
he
send
<integer>
divisions
to
south
vietnam.
kennedy
rejected
that
advice.
in
may
<year>
,
mcnamara
paid
his
first
visit
to
south
vietnam
,
where
he
told
the
press
``
every
quantitative
measurement
...
shows
that
we
are
winning
the
war
''
.
led
by
general
paul
d.
harkins
,
the
officers
of
the
military
assistance
command
,
vietnam
altered
a
map
that
showed
too
much
of
south
vietnam
under
viet
cong
control
,
and
massaged
the
statistics
to
make
the
viet
cong
appear
weaker
than
what
they
were.
mcnamara
's
``
quantitative
''
style
based
upon
much
number-crunching
by
computers
about
trends
in
vietnam
missed
the
human
dimension.
aspects
of
the
war
such
popular
views
and
attitudes
in
south
vietnam
,
and
that
the
south
vietnamese
president
ngô
đình
diệm
favored
a
``
divide
and
rule
''
strategy
of
having
multiple
government
departments
compete
against
one
another
as
a
way
of
staying
in
power
were
missed
by
mcnamara
's
``
quantitative
''
approach
as
there
was
no
way
that
computers
could
calculate
these
aspects
of
the
war.
though
mcnamara
had
supported
plans
to
intervene
in
laos
in
<year>
,
by
<year>
he
had
changed
his
mind.
during
a
discussion
with
general
lyman
lemnitzer
,
the
chairman
of
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
,
mcnamara
had
stumped
him
by
asking
him
what
the
united
states
would
do
in
the
event
of
several
scenarios
in
laos
,
none
of
which
lemnitzer
and
the
chiefs
were
capable
of
answering.
the
inability
of
the
joint
chiefs
to
answer
mcnamara
's
questions
about
what
the
united
states
should
do
if
north
vietnam
should
stage
a
major
offensive
down
the
mekong
river
valley
from
laos
into
cambodia
and
finally
south
vietnam
persuaded
mcnamara
that
the
joint
chiefs
had
no
vision
of
the
issues
,
and
were
merely
advocating
intervention
in
laos
to
avoid
looking
weak.in
<year>
,
mcnamara
supported
a
plan
for
mass
spraying
of
the
rice
fields
with
herbicides
in
the
phu
yen
mountains
to
starve
the
viet
cong
out
,
a
plan
that
was
only
stopped
when
w.
averell
harriman
pointed
out
to
kennedy
that
the
ensuing
famine
would
kill
thousands
of
innocent
people.
in
late
<year>
,
mcnamara
ordered
planning
to
withdraw
the
american
advisers
from
south
vietnam
in
<year>
as
according
to
pentagon
calculations
the
war
should
be
won
by
then.
at
the
time
,
mcnamara
told
kennedy
:
``
there
is
a
new
feeling
of
confidence
that
victory
is
possible
''
.on
<day>
,
mcnamara
's
rosy
projections
and
assumptions
based
upon
what
his
computers
had
told
him
about
vietnam
were
rudely
shattered
by
the
battle
of
ap
bac
,
that
began
when
three
viet
cong
(
vc
)
companies
were
encircled
by
the
arvn
's
<integer>th
division
in
the
village
of
ap
bac.
despite
being
outnumbered
by
a
factor
of
<integer><integer>
and
being
outgunned
having
only
rifles
compared
to
the
<integer>th
division’s
tanks
,
artillery
,
armored
personnel
carriers
and
helicopters
,
the
vc
defeated
the
<integer>th
division
in
the
ensuing
battle
and
escaped
into
the
jungle.
colonel
john
paul
vann
,
the
american
adviser
attached
to
the
<integer>th
division
summed
up
the
battle
in
a
report
in
his
usual
earthy
language
as
:
``
a
miserable
fucking
performance
,
just
like
what
it
always
is
''
.
vann
,
a
colorful
figure
whose
outspokenly
blunt
criticism
of
how
the
war
was
being
fought
made
him
a
favorite
of
the
media
,
was
much
disliked
by
mcnamara
,
who
did
not
appreciate
the
criticism
as
he
continued
to
insist
that
the
war
was
being
won.vann
's
reports
criticizing
diệm
's
regime
as
corrupt
and
incompetent
were
most
unwelcome
to
mcnamara
who
contended
that
the
reforms
advocated
by
vann
were
unnecessary.
in
march
<year>
,
vann
resigned
from
the
army
as
he
was
informed
that
his
career
was
over.
after
the
battle
of
ap
bac
,
a
debate
began
in
the
kennedy
cabinet
about
the
viability
of
the
diệm
regime
,
which
was
reinforced
by
the
buddhist
crisis
,
which
began
in
may
<year>.
when
the
subject
of
supporting
a
coup
against
diệm
was
first
raised
by
kennedy
at
a
national
security
council
meeting
in
august
<year>
,
mcnamara
spoke
in
favor
of
retaining
diệm.
on
<day>
,
paul
kattenburg
,
a
diplomat
newly
returned
from
saigon
suggested
at

mcnamara
and
vice
president
johnson
that
the
united
states
should
end
support
for

leave
south

to
its
fate.
mcnamara
was
stoutly
opposed
to
kattenburg
's
suggestion
,
saying
``
we
have
been
winning
the
war
''
.unable
to
gain
a
consensus
about
what
to
do

in
september
<year>

kennedy
sent
mcnamara
and
general
taylor
on
a
``
fact-finding
mission
''
to
south
vietnam.
at
a
meeting
in
the
gia
long
palace
,
president
diem
showed
mcnamara
various
graphs
and
charts
that
purported
to
be
proof
that
the
war
was
being
won
,
a
performance
that
convinced
mcnamara
the
war
was
as
good
as
won.
kennedy
wanted
a
negative
assessment
of
diệm
to
justify
supporting
a
coup
,
but
mcnamara
and
taylor
instead
wrote
about
the
``
great
progress
''
achieved
by
diệm
and
confidently
predicted
that
the
``
bulk
''
of
the
american
advisers
would
leave
in

by
that
point
they
predicted
the
vc

crushed.
mcnamara
predicted
that

his
policies

that
by

lyman
kirkpatrick
of

was
``

.
the
same
month
saw
a
vc
battalion
in
the
mekong
delta
escape
from
a
larger
force
of
south
vietnamese
troops
,
who
had
been
rated
as
some
of
the
very
best
in
the
arvn
by
the
american
advisers
who
had
trained
them
,
a
battle
that
underscored
the
problems
in
the
arvn.on
<day>
,
mcnamara
visited
south
vietnam
to
report
to
president
johnson
about
how
well
the
new
regime
of
khánh
was
handling
the
war.
upon
landing
in
saigon
,
mcnamara
told
the
press
:
``
we
shall
stay
for
as
long
it
takes
to
...
win
the
battle
against
the
communist
insurgents
''
.
during
his
visit
,
mcnamara
spoke
memorized
phrases
in
mangled
vietnamese
(
mcnamara
kept
forgetting
that
vietnamese
is
a
tonal
language
)
in
speeches
praising
khánh
as
south
vietnam
's
``
best
possible
leader
''
.
mcnamara
always
ended
his
speeches
by
shouting
out
what
he
thought
was
a
phrase
meaning
``
long
live
a
free
vietnam
!
''
,
but
as
he
used
the
wrong
tones
,
instead
he
said
``
vietnam
,
go
to
sleep
!
''
mcnamara
pressed
khánh
to
put
south
vietnam
on
a
war
footing
by
conscripting
all
able-bodied
young
men
into
the
military
,
which
he
promised
he
would
do.
khánh
did
not
keep
his
promise
as
wealthy
and
middle
class
south
vietnamese
families
objected
to
having
their
sons
conscripted
,
and
as
a
result
the
burden
of
conscription
called
by
khánh
's
national
service
law
fell
only
on
sons
of
poor
families
,
provoking
much
resentment.
after
returning
to
washington
on
<integer>
march
,
mcnamara
reported
to
johnson
that
the
situation
had
``
unquestionably
been
growing
worse
''
since
his
last
visit
in
december
<year>
with
<integer>
%
of
the
countryside
now
under
``
vietcong
control
or
predominant
influence
''
;
most
of
the
south
vietnamese
people
were
displaying
``
apathy
and
indifference
''
;
the
desertion
rate
in
the
arvn
was
``
high
and
increasing
''
while
the
vc
were
``
recruiting
energetically
''
.
the
``
greatest
weakness
''
accordingly
to
mcnamara
was
the
``
uncertain
viability
''
of
khánh
's
government
,
which
might
be
overthrown
at
any
moment
as
the
arvn
was
ridden
with
factionalism
and
intrigue.to
save
south
vietnam
,
mcnamara
recommended
that
the
united
states
make
it
``
emphatically
clear
''
its
willingness
to
support
khánh
to
the
hilt.
other
recommendations
,
which
were
accepted
in
a
national
security
council
``
action
memorandum
''
called
for
the
united
states
to
pay
for
an
increase
in
the
arvn
,
provide
the
republic
of
vietnam
air
force
with
more
planes

,
and
for
the
united
states
to
pay
for
more
civil
servants
to
administer
rural
south
vietnam.
more
importantly
,
the
``
action
memorandum
''
redefined
the
vietnam
war
as
not
only
important
for
asia
,
but
for
the
entire
world
as
the
document
asserted
the
global
credibility
of
the
united
states
was
now
at
stake
as
it
was
claimed
america
's
allies
would
lose
faith
in
american
promises
if
the
south
vietnamese
government
were
overthrown.
the
``
action
memorandum
''
argued
that
to
``

called

``
mcnamara
's
war
''
.
in
response
,
mcnamara
told
the
press
that
he
was
honored
,
saying
``
i
think
it
is
a
very
important

and
i
am

''
.
in
may
<year>
,
senator
richard
russell
advised
johnson
against
relying
too
much
on
mcnamara
,
saying
``
mcnamara
is
the
smartest
fella
any
of
us
know.
but
he
's
got
too
much-he
's
opinionated
as
hell-and
he
's
made
up
his
mind
''
.
russell
told
johnson
that
he
should
find
an
expert
,
preferably
a
world
war
two
general
who
was
``
not
scared
to
death
of
mcnamara
''
to
go
to
south
vietnam
to
say
that
the
war
was
unwinnable
and
that
the
united
states
should
pull
out
,
advice
that
johnson
rejected.although
south
vietnam
by
<year>
was
receiving
a
sum
of
american
economic
and
military
aid
that
ran
to
$
<integer>
million
per
day
,
the
south
vietnamese
state
was
falling
apart
with
corruption
reaching
such
a
point
that
most
south
vietnamese
civil
servants
and
soldiers
were
not
being
paid
while
the
projects
for
``
rural
pacification
''
that
the
united
states
had
paid
for
had
collapsed
as
the
money
had
instead
been
stolen.
the
advice
that
mcnamara
and
other
american
officials
gave
to
the
south
vietnamese
to
make
reforms
to
crack
down
on
corruption
and
make
the
government
more
effective
was
always
ignored
as
by
this
point
the
south
vietnamese
government
knew
very
well
that
the
americans
,
having
repeatedly
promised
in
public
that
they
would
never
permit
the
``
loss
''
of
south
vietnam
,
were
now
prisoners
of
their
own
rhetoric.
the
threats
to
withhold
aid
were
bluffs
,
which
the
south
vietnamese
exposed
by
simply
ignoring
the
american
advice
,
leading
to
a
situation
whereby
stanley
karnow
,
the
vietnam
correspondent
for
the
time
noted
:
''
...
america
lacked
leverage
...
for
the
south
vietnamese
knew
that
the
united
states
could
not
abandon
them
without
damaging
its
own
prestige.
so
despite
their
reliance
on
american
aid
,
now
more
than
a
half-billion
dollars
a
year
,
they
could
safely
defy
american
dictates.
in
short
,
their
weakness
was
their
strength
''
.
one
south
vietnamese
minister
told
karnow
at
the
time
:
``
our
big
advantage
over
the
americans
is
that
they
want
to
win
the
war
more
than
we
do
''
.
to
compensate
for
the
weaknesses
of
the
south
vietnamese
state
,
by
late
winter
of
<year>
,
senior
officials
in
the
johnson
administration
such
as
mcnamara
's
deputy
,
william
bundy
,
the
assistant
secretary
of
defense
,
were
advocating
american
intervention
in
the
war.
such
intervention
presented
a
constitutional
problem
:
to
intervene
on
the
scale
envisioned
would
mean
waging
war
,
and
only
congress
had
the
legal
power
to
declare
war.
fearful
of
causing
a
war
with
china
,
johnson
was
opposed
to
the
plans
of
khánh
to
invade
north
vietnam
,
and
he
was
even
less
enthusiastic
about
having
the
united
states
invade
north
vietnam.
to
declare
war
on
north
vietnam
would
lead
to
irresistible
political
pressure
at
home
to
invade
north
vietnam.
as
such
,
the
solution
was
floated
for
congress
to
pass
a
resolution
granting
johnson
the
power
to
wage
war
in
vietnam.by
<year>
,
the
u.s.
navy
sent
destroyers
into
the
gulf
of
tonkin
to
support
raids
by
south
vietnamese
commandos
on
north
vietnam
and
to
gather
intelligence.
on
<day>
,
one
destroyer
,
the

was
involved
in
a
naval
skirmish
with
north
vietnamese
vietnam
people

boats
within
north
vietnamese
waters.
on
<day>
,
the
maddox
and
another
destroyer
,
the
uss
turner
joy
,
initially
claimed
to
have
been
attacked
by
the
north
vietnamese
torpedo
boats
in
international
waters
on
a
stormy
night
,
but
shortly
afterward
reported
there
was
probably
no
attack.
captain
john
j.
herrick
of
the
maddox
reported
that
the
``
torpedo
boats
''
were
almost
certainly
just
radar
``
blips
''
caused
by
the
``
freak
weather
effects
''
of
the
storm
and
the
reports
of
an
attack
on
his
ship
were
due
to
an
``
overeager
''
radar
operator
who
mistook
the
motors
of
the
ship
for
the
rush
of
torpedoes.
johnson
promptly
seized
upon
the
reports
of
an
attack
on
a
navy
warship
in
international
waters
to
ask
congress
to
pass
a
resolution
giving
him
the
authority
to
wage
war
in
vietnam.
mcnamara
,
via
admiral
u.
s.
grant
sharp
jr.
of
the
pacific
fleet
,
put
strong
pressure
on
herrick
to
say
that
his
ship
had
been
attacked
by
torpedo
boats
,
despite
his
strong
doubts
on
the
subject.
on
<day>
,
mcnamara
appeared
before
congress
to
present
proof
of
what
he
claimed
was
an
attack
on
the
navy
's
warships
in
international
waters
of
the
gulf
of
tonkin
and
stated
it
was
imperative
that
congress
pass
the
resolution
as
quickly
as
possible.
records
from
the
lyndon
johnson
library
have
indicated
that
mcnamara
may
have
misled
johnson
on
the
purported
attack
on
a
u.s.
navy
destroyer
by
allegedly
withholding
recommendations
from
us
pacific
commanders
against
executing
airstrikes.
mcnamara
was
also
instrumental
in
presenting
the
event
to
congress
and
the
public
as
justification
for
escalation
of
the
war
against
the
communists.
in
<year>
,
mcnamara
met
with

told
his

mcnamara
eventually
came
to
accept.president

''
regardless
of
the
particulars
of
the
incident
,
the
larger
issue
would
turn
out
to
be
the
sweeping
powers
granted
by
the
resolution.
it
gave
johnson
virtually
unfettered
authority
to
expand
retaliation
for

``
the

''
mcnamara
wrote
later.
though
johnson
now
had
the
authority
to
wage
war
,
he
proved
reluctant
to
use
it
,
for
example
by
ignoring

,
mcnamara
together
with
the
national
security
adviser
mcgeorge
bundy
co-wrote
a
memo
to
president

stating
``
both
of
us
are
now
pretty
well
convinced
that
our
present
policy
can
lead

were
steadily

.
bundy
and
mcnamara
wrote
``
the
time
for

come
for
hard
choices
''
as
the
united

now
had
the
alternatives
of
either
negotiating

``
salvage

can
be
preserved
''
or
to
resort
to
intervention
to
``
force

''
.
both
bundy
and
mcnamara
stated
that
they
favored
the
latter
,
arguing
that
the
commitment
of
u.s
troops
to
fight
in
south
vietnam
and
a
strategic
bombing
campaign
against

were
now
required.
mcnamara
's
hawkish
stance
on
vietnam
was
well
known
in
washington
and
many
in
the
press
often
referred
to
the
war
as
``
mcnamara

as
he
was
the
one
in

pressing
for

mcnamara
was
forced
to
tell
johnson
that
the
flaming
dart
raids
had
done
little
damage
owning
to
the
heavy
clouds
,
which
caused
the
pilots
to
miss
when
dropping
their
bombs
,
and
more
raids
would
be
needed.
on

johnson

approved

general

,
vietnam
(

,
cabled
johnson
to
say
that

was
vulnerable
as
he
had
no
faith
in
the
ability
of
the
south
vietnamese
to
protect
it
,
leading
him
to
ask
for
american
troops
to
be
deployed
instead.
on
<day>
,
two
battalions
from

marine
corps
were
landed

making
the

mcnamara
urged
johnson
to
send
<integer>
,
<integer>
troops
to
vietnam
,
advice
that
was
accepted.by
june
<year>
,
westmoreland
was
reporting
that
south
vietnam
was
faced
with
a
``
collapse
''
,
which
would
require
<integer>
,
<integer>
troops
to
stop
,
which
would
be
just
a

,
and

needed
``
to

''
.
mcnamara
's
advice
in

<year>
to
johnson
was
to
commit
more
<integer>
,
<integer>
troops
to
south
vietnam
together
with
a
stepped
up
aerial
offensive
to
destroy
north
vietnam
's
economy
was
called
by
bundy
``
rash
to
the
point
of
folly
''
.
bundy
stated
that
for
johnson
to
agree
to
mcnamara
's
request
to
send
more
troops
``
was
a
slippery
slope
toward
total
u.s.
responsibility
and
corresponding
fecklessness
on
the
vietnamese
side
''
.
bundy
argued
that
it
was
the
responsibility
of
the
south
vietnamese
government
to
stop
the
vc
and
that
if
the
americans
continued
to
do
all
the
fighting
,
then
the
united
states
would
lack
the
necessary
leverage
to
pressure
saigon
into
making
reforms
,
turning
``
...
the
conflict
into
a
white
man
's
war
,
with
the
united
states
in
the
shoes
of
the
french
''
.
to
resolve
the
debate
,
later
in
july
<year>
,
mcnamara
visited
south
vietnam
on
yet
another
``
fact-finding
mission
''
for
president
johnson
and
met
the
new
south
vietnamese
premier
,
air
marshal
nguyễn
cao
kỳ
,
who
had
just
overthrown
khánh.
air
marshal
kỳ
wore
a
flamboyant
uniform
which
he
had
designed
himself
of
a
white
jacket
,
black
pants
,
red
socks
and
black
shoes
which
led
mcnamara
to
dub
him
as
looking
``
like
a
saxophone
player
in
a
second-rate
nightclub
''
.
mcnamara
was
not
impressed
with
kỳ
,
reporting
to
johnson
that
he
saw
little
evidence
that
he
was
capable
of
winning
the
war
,
and
the
united
states
would
have
to
send
more
troops
to
south
vietnam.
upon
his
return
to
the
united
states
,
mcnamara
told
the
press
that
the
u.s
forces
in
vietnam
were
inflicting
``
increasingly
heavy
losses
''
on
the
vc
,
but
in
private
told
president
johnson
that
the
situation
was
``
worse
than
a
year
ago
''
.mcnamara
also
advised
the
president
that
by
early
<year>
he
would
have
to
send
<integer>
,
<integer>
more
troops
to
south
vietnam
in
order
to
win
the
war
,
and
he
would
need
to
mobilize
the
reserves
and
state
national
guards
as
well.
johnson
accepted
the
first
recommendation
while
rejecting
the
latter
,
disregarding
bundy
's
warnings
that
to
send
more
troops
would
paradoxically
mean
less
leverage
over
south
vietnam.
to
mobilize
the
reserves
and
national
guards
would
mean
having
to
call
up
hundreds
of
thousands
of
men
from
civilian
life
,
which
would
inevitably
disrupt
the
economy
,
which
in
turn
would
require
ending
the
peacetime
economy
and
putting
the
economy
on
a
war
footing.
johnson
rejected
a
wartime
economy
as
imposing
too
many
sacrifices
on
ordinary
americans
while
threatening
his
chances
for
reelection.
because
the
reserves
were
never
called
up
,
the
army
had
to
send
much
of
its
manpower
to
vietnam
,
leaving
the
u.s
divisions
in
western
europe
in
a
``
skeletal
''
condition
as
there
was
a
shortage
of
volunteers.
to
make
up
the
shortfall
,
the
army
had
to
rely
upon
the
draft
,
which
caused
much
domestic
opposition
,
especially
as
the
draft
system
offered
generous
exemptions
for
those
attending
university
and
college
,
leading
to
the
burden
of
the
draft
falling
disproportionately
upon
men
from
poorer
families.
because
of
the
refusal
to
call
up
the
reserves
,
mcnamara
had
to
increase
the
draft
call
in
july
<year>
from
<integer>
,
<integer>
per
month
to
<integer>
,
<integer>
per
month.
as
most
of
the
<integer>
and
<integer>-year-old
draftees
had
a
high
school
diploma
or
less
,
this
also
led
to
a
decline
in
the
army
's
intellectual
standards
,
with
many
officers
complaining
that
most
of
the
draftees
were
not
intelligent
enough
to
be
trained
for
technical
duties
or
promoted
up
the
ranks.
throughout
the
war
,
the
chairman
of
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
,
general
earle
wheeler
,
pressed
very
strongly
for
the
reserves
and
national
guards
to
be
called
out
,
saying
the
war
was
steadily
ruining
the
u.s.
army.
though
mcnamara
warned
the
president
in
july
<year>
that
the
war
would
cost
an
extra
$
<integer>
billion
dollars
in
defense
spending
over
the
next
year
,
johnson
at
a
press
conference
said
his
administration
would
be
spending
only
an
extra
$
<integer>–<integer>
million
dollars
until
january
<year>.
mcnamara
warned
that
the
increased
spending
would
spark
inflation
and
raise
the
deficit
,
advising

to
ask
congress
to
increase
taxes
to
forestall
those
eventualities.
johnson
responded
that
congress
would
not
vote
for
higher
taxes
,
leading
mcnamara
to
argue
that
the
president
should
at
least
try
,
saying
``
i
would
rather
fight
for
what
's
right
and
fail
than
not
try
''
.
johnson
snapped

,
a

burned
himself
alive
in
the
parking
lot
of
the
pentagon
to
protest
the
war.
all
mcnamara
saw
from
his
office
was
the
smoke
rising
from
the
parking
lot
,
but
he
was
sufficiently
troubled
by
the
incident
that
he
refused
to
discuss
it
with
his
family
,
all
the
more
so
because
his
wife
margey
was
opposed
to
the
war
and
sympathized
with
morrison
's
feelings
,
if
not
his
suicide.
on
<day>
,
mcnamara
sent
johnson
a
memo
saying
that
the
``
substantial
loss
of
american
lives
''
in
vietnam
was
worth
the
sacrifice
in
order
to
contain
china
,
which
mcnamara
called
the
world
's
most
dangerous
nation.
mcnamara
wrote
that
the
deployment
of
troops
to
south
vietnam
would
``
make
sense
only
if
they
are
in
support
of
a
long-term
united
states
policy
to
contain
china
''
,
writing
that
the
process
of
``
containing
''
china
would
require
``
american
attention
,
money
and
,
from
time
to
time
unfortunately
lives
''
.the
casualty
lists
mounted
as
the
number
of
troops
and
the
intensity
of
fighting
escalated.
mcnamara
put
in
place
a
statistical
strategy
for
victory
in
vietnam.
he
concluded
that
there
were
a
limited
number
of
vc
fighters
in
south
vietnam
and
that
a
war
of
attrition
would
destroy
them.
he
applied
metrics
(
body
counts
)
to
determine
how
close
to
success
his
plan
was.
faced
with
a
guerrilla
war
,
the
question
of
holding
territory
was
irrelevant
as
the
vc
never
operated
for
extended
periods
in
areas
where
the
americans
were
strong
and
if
the
americans
occupied
an
area
in
force
,
the
vc
simply
moved
to
other
areas
where
the
american
presence
was
weaker.
westmoreland
had
decided
,
with
the
support
of
mcnamara
,
to
defend
all
of
south
vietnam
,
believing
that
he
could
win
via
a
strategy
of
attrition
as
he
would
simply
inflict
enough
losses
to
end
the
enemy
's
ability
to
wage
war.
mcnamara
devised
the
``
body
count
''
measurement
to
determine
how
well
the
americans
were
doing
,
reasoning
if
the
americans
were
inflicting
heavy
losses
as
measured
by
the
``
body
count
''
,
it
must
be
a
sign
that
they
were
winning.
general
william
peers
wrote
critically
of
the
``
body
count
''
strategy
,
stating
:
``
...
with
improper
leadership
,
'body
count
'
could
create
competition
between
units
,
particularly
if
these
statistics
were
compared
like
baseball
standings
and
there
were
no
stringent
requirements
as
to
how
and
by
whom
the
counts
were
to
be
made
''
.
the
obsession
with
``
body
counts
''
led
to
much
exaggeration
of
the
losses
inflicted
on
the
enemy
as
the
officers
with
the
highest
``
body
counts
''
were
promoted
while
also
fueling
a
grisly
competition
between
units
to
achieve
the
highest
``
body
counts
''
that
led
to
innocent
civilians
being
killed
to
inflate
their
daily
``
body
counts
''
.
it
is
generally
accepted
by
historians
that
the
vast
daily
losses
that
u.s.
officers
claimed
to
have
inflicted
on
the
vc
were
fabricated
as
many
officers
desperate
for
a
promotion
reported
``
body
counts
''
well
above
what
they
were
actually
achieving.the
u.s.
army
sabotaged
the
efforts
of
kennedy
and
mcnamara
to
develop
a
more
counterinsurgency
role
by
simply
declaring
that
the
army
's
basic
unit
,
the
division
,
was
flexible
enough
to
engage
against
guerrillas
while
also
promising
that
the
traditional
fondness
for
using
maximum
firepower
would
not
present
a
problem
as
firepower
use
would
be
``
discriminating
''
.
in
vietnam
,
this
led
to
divisions
,
whose
size
limited
them
and
their
supply
trains
to
the
road
,
using
massive
amounts
of
firepower
against
guerrillas
who
were
often
``
nimble
''
enough
to
evade
all
of
the
firepower
brought
to
bear.
instead
,
the
standard
tactics
of
bringing
massive
firepower
to
bear
in
the
form
of
napalm
and
artillery
strikes
against
the
guerrillas
often
killed
civilians
,
fueling
support
for
the
vc.
the
special
forces
did
fight
in
vietnam
,
but
only
as
an
adjutant
to
the
traditional
infantry
and
armored
divisions
,
which
did
most
of
the
fighting.
in
a
<year>
memo
,
mcnamara
admitted
that
the
sort
of
counterinsurgency
war
envisioned
by
kennedy
with
the
special
forces
leading
the
fight
had
not
occurred
,
and
wrote
that
the
responsibility
for
this
``
undoubtedly
lies
with
bad
management
''
on
the
part
of
the
army.
====
disenchantment
====
up
to
november
<year>
,
mcnamara
,
who
been
a
supporter
of
the
war
,
first
started
to
have
doubts
about
the
war
,
saying
at
a
press
conference
that
``
it
will
be
a
long
war
''
,
which
completely
contradicted
his
previous
optimistic
statements
that
the
war
would
be
brought
to
a
close
soon.
although
he
was
a
prime
architect
of
the
vietnam
war
and
repeatedly
overruled
the
jcs
on
strategic
matters
,
mcnamara
gradually
became
skeptical
about
whether
the
war
could
be
won
by
deploying
more
troops
to
south
vietnam
and
intensifying
the
bombing
of
north
vietnam
,
a
claim
he
would
publish
in
a
book
years
later.
he
also
stated
later
that
his
support
of
the
war
was
given
out
of
loyalty
to
administration
policy.
he
traveled
to
south
vietnam
many
times
to
study
the
situation
firsthand
and
became
increasingly
reluctant
to
approve
the
large
force
increments
requested
by
the
military
commanders.as
a
christmas
gesture
,
johnson
ordered
a
bombing
pause
over
north
vietnam
and
went
off
to
his
ranch
in
texas
for
the
holidays.
mcnamara
went
with
his
family
for
skiing
in
colorado
,
but
upon
hearing
that
the
president
was
open
to
extending
the
bombing
pause
for
a
few
more
days
,
he
left
his
family
at
the
sky
lodge
in
the
rockies
to
fly
to
the
johnson
ranch
on
<day>.
mcnamara
knew
that
johnson
tended
to
listen
to
the
advice
of
rusk
who
saw
extending
the
bombing
pause
as
weakness
,
and
wanted
a
meeting
with
johnson
without
rusk
present.
mcnamara
argued
to
the
president
in
a
three
hour
long
meeting
that
the
north
vietnamese
would
not
open
peace
talks
unless
the
bombing
were
stopped
first
,
as
they
kept
saying
repeatedly
,
and
persuaded
johnson
to
extend
the
bombing
pause
into
january.
at
a
new
year
's
eve
party
attended
by
washington
's
elite
to
welcome
<year>
,
mcnamara
expressed
doubts
about
america
's
ability
to
win
the
war.
a
week
later
at
a
dinner
party
attended
by
the
economist
john
kenneth
galbraith
and
johnson
's
speechwriter
dick
goodwin
,
mcnamara
stated
that
victory
was
unobtainable
,
and
the
best
that
could
be
achieved
was
an
``
honorable
withdrawal
''
that
might
save
south
vietnam
as
a
state.
in
february
<year>
,
during
the
honolulu
conference
,
mcnamara
during
an
``
off-the-record
''
chat
with
a
group
of
journalists
spoke
about
the
war
in
very
jaded
terms
,
stating
frankly
that
operation
rolling
thunder
was
a
failure.
mcnamara
stated
that
north
vietnam
was
a
backward
third
world
country
that
did
not
have
the
same
advanced
industrial
infrastructure
of
first
world
nations
,
making
the
bombing
offensive
useless.
mcnamara
concluded
:
``
no
amount
of
bombing
can
end
the
war
''
.
karnow
,
one
of
the
journalists
present
during
the
``
off-the-record
''
conversation
,
described
mcnamara
's
personality
as
having
changed
,
noting
the
defense
secretary
,
who
was
normally
so
arrogant
and
self-assured
,
convinced
he
could
``
scientifically
''
solve
any
problem
,
as
being
subdued
and
clearly
less
self-confident.in
october
<year>
,
mcnamara
returned
from
yet
another
visit
to
south
vietnam
,
full
of
confidence
in
public
and
doubt
in
private.
mcnamara
told
the
media
that
``
process
has
exceeded
our
expectations
''
while
telling
the
president
he
saw
``
no
reasonable
way
to
bring
the
war
to
an
end
soon
''
.
though
mcnamara
reported
to
johnson
that
american
forces
were
inflicting
heavy
losses
on
the
north
vietnamese
and
vc
,
he
added
that
they
could
``
more
than
replace
''
their
losses
and
that
``
full
security
exists
nowhere
''
in
south
vietnam
,
even
in
areas
supposedly
``
pacified
''
by
the
americans.
worst
of
all
,
mcnamara
complained
that
the
south
vietnamese
were
still
not
carrying
their
full
share
of
the
load
,
as
they
expected
the
americans
to
do
all
the
fighting
for
them
,
stating
:
``
this
important
war
must
be
fought
and
won
by
the
vietnamese
themselves.
we
have
known
this
from
the
beginning.
but
the
discouraging
truth
is
that
,
as
was
the
case
in
<year>
and
<year>
and
<year>
,
we
have
not
found
the
formula
,
the
catalyst
,
for
training
and
inspiring
them
into
effective
action
''
.in
november
<year>
,
mcnamara
visited
harvard
university
and
the
car
driving
him
to
see
henry
kissinger
was
surrounded
by
anti-war
protesters
who
forced
the
automobile
to
stop.
the
students
refused
to
let
the
car
move
until
mcnamara
debated
their
leader
,
michael
ansara
,
the
president
of
the
harvard
chapter
of
students
for
a
democratic
society.
mcnamara
agreed
to
the
debate
,
and
standing
on
the
hood
of
his
car
answered
the
charge
from
a
student
in
the
crowd
that
the
united
states
was
waging
aggression
by
saying
the
war
started
in
<year>
,
not
<year>
,
which
he
knew
``
because
the
international
control
commission
wrote
a
report
that
said
so.
you
have
n't
read
it
,
and
if
you
have
,
you
obviously
did
n't
understand
it
''
.
when
the
student
answered
that
he
had
read
the
international
control
commission
's
report
and
it
did
not
say
that
,
mcnamara
responded
he
had
been
a
far
better
university
student
than
his
opponent
,
saying
``
i
was
tougher
than
you
then
and
i
'm
tougher
today
!
i
was
more
courteous
then
,
and
i
hope
i
'm
more
courteous
today
!
''
.
as
mcnamara
continued
to
insult
the
crowd
and
the
mood
grew
more
ugly
,
he
fled
into
quincy
house
,
from
which
he
escaped
via
underground
tunnels
to
see
kissinger.
the
confrontation
with
the
students
had
shaken
him
,
and
it
took
half
an
hour
before
he
was
ready
to
address
kissinger
's
class.because
the
effects
of
operation
rolling
thunder
were
more
easily
measured
than
with
the
ground
war
,
mcnamara
was
especially
troubled
by
the
revelation
that
the
bombing
offensive
had
not
caused
the
collapse
of
north
vietnam
's
economy
as
predicted.
in
june
<year>
,
american
bombers
hit
north
vietnam
's
hydroelectric
plants
and
reduced
north
vietnam
capacity
to
generate
electricity
by
<integer>
%
,
accordingly
to
mcnamara
's
calculations.
at
the
same
time
,
he
also
calculated
that
the
annual
amount
of
electricity
generated
in
north
vietnam
was
equal
only
to
a
fifth
of
the
electricity
generated
every
year
at
the
potomac
electric
power
company
's
plant
in
alexandria
,
virginia
,
making
the
destruction
of
north
vietnamese
power
plants
meaningless
to
the
outcome
of
the
war
as
the
amount
of
electricity
generated
was
so
small.
he
also
calculated
in
<year>
that
over
the
last
two
years
,
american
bombers
had
inflicted
damage
on
north
vietnam
equal
to
about
$
<integer>
million
while
at
the
same
time
,
rolling
thunder
had
cost
the
u.s.
air
force
about
<integer>
aircraft
shot
down
over
north
vietnam
whose
total
value
was
about
$
<integer>
million
,
making
the
bombing
campaign
uneconomical.
mcnamara
's
doubts
were
encouraged
by
his
civilian
aides
such
as
leslie
h.
gelb
and
john
mcnaughton
,
who
complained
that
their
wives
and
teenage
children
were
chiding
them
as
``
war
criminals
''
when
they
came
home
from
work.
mcnamara
's
own
teenage
son
,
robert
craig
mcnamara
,
was
opposed
to
the
war
and
denounced
his
father
when
he
came
from
work
every
day.
mcnamara
was
shocked
to
discover
that
the
american
flag
was
hanging
upside
down
in
his
son
's
bedroom
as
the
younger
mcnamara
told
him
that
he
was
ashamed
of
america
because
of
him.
mcnaughton
told
mcnamara
that
after
having
talked
to
some
of
the
young
people
that
``
a
feeling
is
widely
and
strongly
held
...
that
'the
establishment
'
is
out
of
its
mind
''
and
the
dominant
opinion
was
``
that
we
are
trying
to
impose
some
u.s.
image
on
distant
peoples
we
can
not
understand
and
that
we
carrying
the
thing
to
absurd
lengths.
''
in
a
memo
of
<day>
to
the
president
,
mcnamara
stated
the
military
side
of
the
war
was
going
well
with
the
americans
killing
thousands
of
the
enemy
every
month
,
but
the
political
side
was
not
as
south
vietnam
remained
as
dysfunctional
as
ever
as
he
wrote
:
``
corruption
is
widespread.
real
government
control
is
confined
to
enclaves.
there
is
rot
in
the
fabric
''
.
mcnamara
wrote
that
the
idea
that
the
american
forces
would
temporarily
stabilize
the
situation
so
the
south
vietnamese
could
take
over
the
war
themselves
was
flawed
as
the
dysfunctional
south
vietnamese
state
would
never
be
able
to
win
the
war
,
thus
meaning
the
americans
would
have
to
stay
in
vietnam
for
decades
to
come.
he
advised
johnson
not
to
accept
westmoreland
's
call
for
an
additional
<integer>
,
<integer>
soldiers
as
that
would
mean
calling
up
the
reserves
,
which
in
turn
would
require
a
wartime
economy.
the
economic
sacrifices
that
ending
the
peacetime
economy
would
entail
would
make
it
almost
politically
impossible
to
negotiate
peace
,
and
in
effect
would
mean
placing
the
hawks
in
charge
,
which
was
why
those
of
a
hawkish
inclination
kept
pressing
for
the
reserves
to
be
called
up.
the
economic
sacrifices
could
only
be
justified
to
the
american
people
by
saying
the
war
would
be
brought
to
a
victorious
conclusion.
mcnamara
rejected
the
advice
of
the
hawks
,
warning
that
steps
such
as
bombing
north
vietnam
's
dikes
and
locks
to
flood
the
farmland
with
the
aim
of
causing
a
famine
;
mining
the
coast
of
north
vietnam
to
sink
soviet
ships
bringing
in
arms
;
invading
laos
and
cambodia
;
and
finally
in
the
last
resort
using
nuclear
weapons
if
the
other
measures
failed
were
likely
to
alienate
world
opinion
and
increase
domestic
opposition.
mcnamara
wrote
:

.
finally
,
mcnamara
dismissed
the
domino
theory
as
irrelevant
since
general
suharto
had
seized
power
in
indonesia
in
<year>
and
proceeded
to
wipe
out
the
indonesian
communist
party
,
the
third-largest
in
the
world
,
killing
hundreds

of
indonesian

he
argued
that
with
suharto
in
power
in
indonesia
that
``
the
trend

now
running
in

indonesia

of

mcnamara
argued
that

to
fall
,
the
indonesian
``

in
july
<year>
,
mcnamara
was
informed
by
the
british
defense
minister
,
peter
thorneycroft
,
that
the
financial
burden
of
trying
to
maintain
british
forces
around
the
world
was
too
much
,
and
that
the
british
prime

harold

was
considering
a
withdrawal
of
all
british
forces
``
east
of
suez
''
to
end
the
british
military

in
asia.
mcnamara
was
opposed
to
the
contemplated
``
east
of
suez
''
withdrawal
,
but
the
possibility
of
such
a
withdrawal
led
the
u.s.
navy
to
lobby
for
britain
to
allow
an
american
naval
base
to
be
set
up
some
british
island
in
the
indian
ocean
,
a
viewpoint
that
was
formally
endorsed
by
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
in
january
<year>.
the
memo
by
the
joint
chiefs
mentioned
that
a
major
problem
with
british
colonies
was
the
rise
of
nationalist
movements
demanding
independence
,
and
expressed
concern
that
if
the
united
kingdom
were
to
grant
the
united
states
a
base
in
the
indian
ocean
,
an
independence
movement
might
demand
the
withdrawal
of
the
americans.
in
<year>
,
britain
granted
air
and
naval
bases
in
the
colony
of
trinidad
and
tobago
to
the
united
states
,
but
when
trinidad
and
tobago
became
independent
,
the
new
government
asked
for
the
americans
to
leave.
in
addition
,
the
chagossians
were
black
,
and
the
u.s.
navy
were
convinced
that
having
the
chagossians
living
aside
an
american
naval
base
would
result
in
prostitution
,
which
in
turn
would
lead
to
american
sailors
being
infected
with
venereal
diseases
,
thus
leading
the

to
demand

visited

to
meet

and
to
begin

about
which
british
island
in
the
indian
ocean
was
to
have
the
american
base.
by
<year>
,
the
americans
had
selected
the
island
of
diego
garcia
in
the
british
colony
of
the
chagos
archipelago
as
the
ideal
place
for
maintaining
air
and
naval
bases
that
would
allow
the
united

to
control
the

mcnamara
offered
to
have
the
united

pay
$
<integer>
million
u.s.
dollars
annually
in
rent
to
the
british

,
a
request
that

british
accepted.
to
prevent
an
independence
movement
in

from

,
the
americans
informed
the
british
that
they
wanted
all
of

expelled
from
their
homes
and
never
to
be
allowed
to
returned

toward
the

mcnamara
also
opposed
an
anti-ballistic
missile
(
abm
)
system
proposed
for
installation
in
the
u.s.
in
defense
against
soviet
missiles
,
arguing
the
$
<integer>
billion
``
in
itself
is
not
the
problem
;
the
penetrability
of
the
proposed
shield
is
the
problem.
''
under
pressure
to
proceed
with
the
abm
program
after
it
became
clear
that
the
soviets
had
begun
a
similar
project
,
mcnamara
finally
agreed
to
a
``
light
''
system
which
he
believed
could
protect
against
the
far
smaller
number
of
chinese
missiles.
however
,
he
never
believed
it
was
wise
for
the
united
states
to
move
in
that
direction
because
of
psychological
risks
of
relying
too
much
on
nuclear
weaponry
and
that
there
would
be
pressure
from
many
directions
to
build
a
larger
system
than
would
be
militarily
effective.
he
always
believed
that
the
best
defense
strategy
for
the
u.s.
was
a
parity
of
mutually
assured
destruction
with
the
soviet
union.
an
abm
system
would
be
an
ineffective
weapon
as
compared
to
an
increase
in
deployed
nuclear
missile
capacity.

mcnamara
wrote
of
his
close
personal
friendship
with
jackie
kennedy
and
how
she
demanded
that
he
stop
the
killing

as
mcnamara
grew
more
and
more
controversial
after
<year>
and
his
differences
with
the
president
and
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
over
vietnam
strategy
became
the
subject
of
public
speculation
,
frequent
rumors
surfaced
that
he
would
leave
office.
by
<year>
,
mcnamara
was
suffering
visibly
from
the
nervous
strain
as
he
went
days
without
shaving
and
he
suffered
spasms
where
his
jaw
would
quiver
uncontrollably
for
hours.
johnson
said
about
him
:
``
you
know
,
he
's
a
fine

a

.
senator
john
c.
stennis
was
a
conservative
southern
democrat
who
enjoyed
much
influence
as
a
senior
member
of
the
senate
armed
forces
committee.
stennis
saw
himself
more
as
a
champion
of
the
military
rather
than
its
overseer
,
and
as
such
the
military
often
leaked
information
to
him
,
in
the
full
knowledge
that
he
would
take
up
their
cause
on
capitol
hill.
reflecting
their
unhappiness
with
mcnamara
's
leadership
,
in
the
spring
of
<year>
senior
generals
and
admirals
let
stennis
know
of
their
belief
that
the
defense
secretary
was
mismanaging
the
war
,
which
led
him
to
schedule
hearings
for
the
senate
armed
forces
committee
in
august
<year>
to
examine
the
charge
that
``
unskilled
civilian
amateurs
''
(
i.e.
mcnamara
)
were
not
letting
``
professional
military
experts
''
win
the
war
as
he
charged
that
mcnamara
had
placed
too
many
restrictions
on
bombing
north
vietnam
to
protect
innocent
north
vietnamese
civilians.
the
chairman
of
the
senate
armed
forces
committee
,
senator
richard
russell
jr.
,
was
opposed
to
the
war
,
but
he
expressed
his
opposition
in
the
most
cautious
and
lukewarm
terms
as
he
did
not
wish
to
appear
unpatriotic
,
and
so
the
hawkish
stennis
enjoyed
more
power
than
his
title
of
deputy
chairman
of
the
committee
would
suggest.the
hearings
opened
on
<day>
,
and
stennis
called
as
his
witnesses
numerous
admirals
and
air
force
generals
who
all
testified
to
their
belief
that
the
united
states
was
fighting
with
``
one
arm
tied
behind
its
back
''
,
implicitly
criticizing
mcnamara
's
leadership
as
they
complained
of
``
overtly
restrictive
controls
''
in
bombing
north
vietnam
that
they
claimed
were
preventing
them
from
winning
the
war.
when
mcnamara
himself
appeared
as
a
witness
before
the
senate
armed
forces
committee
on
<day>
,
he
defended
the
war
in
very
lukewarm
terms
that
strongly
suggested
he
had
lost
faith
in
the
war
,
testifying
that
the
bombing
campaign
against
north
vietnam
was
ineffective
,
making
the
question
of
the
bombing
restrictions
meaningless.
mcnamara
described
all
of
the
<integer>
restricted
targets
as
either
of
no
importance
such
as
a
tire
factory
in
hanoi
that
produced
only
<integer>
tires
per
day
or
carried
too
much
risk
of
hitting
soviet
ships
bringing
supplies
to
north
vietnam.
he
warned
that
the
prospect
of
american
bombers
damaging
or
sinking
soviet
merchantmen
while
wounding
or
killing
soviet
sailors
carried
too
much
risk
of
causing
world
war
three.
mcnamara
testified
that
the
bombing
campaign
had
failed
to
reduce
the
supplies
coming
down
the
ho
chi
minh
trail
as
the
viet
cong
needed
only
<integer>
tons
of
supplies
per
day
to
continue
to
fight
and
``
even
if
the
quantity
were
five
times
that
amount
,
it
could
be
transported
by
only
a
few
trucks
''
.
mcnamara
went
on
to
say
that
the
bombing
raids
had
not
damaged
the
north
vietnamese
economy
which
was
``
agrarian
and
simple
''
and
the
north
vietnamese
people
were
unfamiliar
with
``
the
modern
comforts
and
conveniences
that
most
of
us
in
the
western
world
take
for
granted
''
.
mcnamara
also
stated
that
north
vietnamese
morale
was
not
broken
by
the
bombing
offensive
as
the
north
vietnamese
people
were
``
accustomed
to
discipline
and
are
no
strangers
to
deprivation
and
death
''
while
everything
indicated
the
leadership
in
hanoi
were
not
affected
by
the
bombing
raids.
thus
,
he
lacked
``
any
confidence
that
they
can
be
bombed
to
the
negotiating
table
''
.
mcnamara
concluded
that
only
some
sort
of
genocide
could
actually
win
the
war
,
stating
:
``
enemy
operations
in
the
south
can
not
,
on
the
basis
of
any
reports
i
have
seen
be
stopped
by
air
bombardment-short
,
that
is
,
of
the
virtual
annihilation
of
north
vietnam
and
its
people
''
.besides
stennis
,
the
other
members
of
the
senate
armed
forces
committee
were
senators
henry
m.
jackson
,
strom
thurmond
and
stuart
symington
,
all
of
whom
were
very
hostile
to
mcnamara
in
their
questioning
of
him.
senator
thurmond
reproached
mcnamara
:
``
i
think
it
is
a
statement
of
placating
the
communists.
it
is
a
statement
of
appeasing
the
communists.
it
is
a
statement
of
no-win
''
.
privately
,
mcnamara
felt
that
thurmond
was
an
``
ass
''
,
saying
he
was
a
bigoted
,
ignorant
southern
politician
whose
only
values
were
a
mindless
militarism
,
a
fervent
belief
in
white
supremacy
and
a
fondness
for
marrying
women
far
younger
than
himself.
mcnamara
felt
that
it
was
beneath
him
to
be
questioned
by
thurmond
,
which
explained
why
he
was
notably
truculent
in
his
answers
to
thurmond.
stennis
wrote
the
committee
's
report
which
accused
mcnamara
of
having
``
consistently
overruled
the
unanimous
recommendations
of
military
commanders
and
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
''
,
whom
stennis
wrote
had
proposed
``
systematic
,
timely
and
hard-hitting
actions
''
.
stennis
damned
mcnamara
for
putting
in
bombing
restrictions
to
protect
north
vietnamese
civilians
and
claimed
that
the
war
could
be
easily
won
if
only
mcnamara
would
just
obey
all
of
the
advice
he
received
from
the
military.
stennis
was
not
influenced
by
the
hearings
as
he
had
written
the
committee
's
report
before
the
hearings
had
even
began.
johnson
saw
the
hearings
as
proof
that
it
was
time
to
dismiss
mcnamara
,
whom
he
believed
was
``
cracking
up
''
under
the
strain
of
the
war
,
as
reflected
in
the
defense
secretary
's
criticism
of
the
rolling
thunder
bombings.
stennis
,
an
ardent
white
supremacist
who
had
fiercely
opposed
johnson
's
civil
rights
legislation
,
was
an
old
enemy
of
johnson
's
,
which
led
the
president
to
decide
not
to
sack
mcnamara
in
august
<year>
as
that
would
be
seen
as
a
victory
by
stennis
,
and
instead
to
wait
a
few
months
to
fire
mcnamara.
in
an
interview
with
his
biographer
,
doris
kearns
goodwin
,
johnson
stated
that
mcnamara
was
``
cracking
up
''
as
the
pressures
of
the
war
were
too
much
for
him
,
and
so
he
decided
to
fire
him
as
it
would
have
been
``
a
damn
unfair
thing
to
force
him
to
stay
''
.
johnson
had
long
resented
and
hated
the
kennedy
brothers
,
whom
he
charged
looked
down
upon
him
as
``
white
trash
''
from
texas.
senator
robert
f.
kennedy
had
emerged
as
a
leading
critic
of
the
war
by
<year>
,
and
johnson
stated
to
kearns
his
belief
that
mcnamara
had
suffered
a
nervous
breakdown
,
of
which
kennedy
,
a
close
friend
of
mcnamara
,
had
taken
advantage
of.
johnson
told
kearns
:
``
every
day
,
bobby
[
kennedy
]
would
call
up
mcnamara
telling
him
that
the
war
was
terrible
and
immoral
,
and
that
he
had
to
leave
''
.
to
soften
the
blow
,
johnson
claimed
to
kearns
that
he
had
talked
it
over
with
mcnamara
and
had
decided
to
offer
him
the
presidency
of
the
world
bank
,
``
the
only
job
he
really
wanted
then
''
.
johnson
had
chosen
the
job
of
world
bank
president
for
mcnamara
because
its
rules
prohibited
the
president
from
involving
himself
in
the
domestic
affairs
of
member
nations
,
which
would
prevent
mcnamara
from
criticizing
the
war
after
he
left
office.
johnson
's
biggest
fear
was
that
if
he
fired
mcnamara
,
then
he
might
join
with
kennedy
in
criticizing
him
and
the
war
;
given
his
status
as
the
longest-serving
defense
secretary
,
such
criticism
would
be
especially
damaging.
when
a
reporter
asked
mcnamara
if
the
stennis
hearings
indicated
a
rift
between
him
and
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
,
mcnamara
replied
:
``
my
polices
do
n't
differ
with
those
of
the
joint
chiefs
and
i
think
they
would
be
the
first
to
say
it
''
.
general
earle
``
bus
''
wheeler
,
the
chairman
of
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
had
become
dissatisfied
with
mcnamara

leadership
and
was
outraged
by
that
remark.
in
response
to
mcnamara
's
claim
that
the
joint
chiefs
supported
him
,
he
proposed
that
the
joint
chiefs
all
resign
in
protest
at
mcnamara
's
leadership.
general
harold
k.
johnson
of
the
army
,
who
erroneously
blamed
mcnamara
for
johnson
's
decision
not
to
call
up
the
reserves
in
<year>
,
agreed
to
wheeler
's
plan
with
his
only
regret
being
that
he
did
not
resign
in
<year>.
the
plan
collapsed
when
general
wallace
m.
greene
of
the
marine
corps
refused
to
go
along
with
it.on
<day>
,
mcnamara
saw
the
march
on
the
pentagon
anti-war
protest
from
his
office
in
the
pentagon
as
he
witnessed
hippie
girls
placed
flowers
in
the
guns
of
the
d.c
national
guardsman
standing
in
front
of
the
pentagon.
mcnamara
described
the
scenes
he
witnessed
as
``
hellish
''
as
the
hippie
girls
bared
their
breasts
to
tempt
the
guardsman
to
``
make
love
,
not
war
''
while
other
hippies
spitted
in
the
faces
of
the
guardsman.
however
,
despite
seeing
the
march
on
the
pentagon
demonstrators
as
a
sign
of
social
decay
,
his
characteristic
competitive
spirit
came
to
the
fore
as
he
argued
that
if
he
had
been
leading
the
march
on
the
pentagon
,
he
would
had
taken
over
the
pentagon
and
shut
it
down
,
saying
hippies
lacked
the
necessary
discipline
and
intelligence.
on
<day>
,
mcnamara
wrote
johnson
a
memo
which
he
sent
the
next
day
saying
that
the
war
could
not
be
continued
as
it
``
would
be
dangerous
,
costly
in
lives
and
unsatisfactory
to
the
american
people
''
.
johnson
wrote
on
the
margins
on
the
memo
remarks
such
as
``
how
do
we
get
this
conclusion
?
''
and
``
why
believe
this
?
''
in
an
early
november
<year>
memorandum
to
johnson
,
mcnamara
's
recommendation
to
freeze
troop
levels
,
stop
bombing
north
vietnam
and
for
the
u.s.
to
hand
over
ground
fighting
to
south
vietnam
was
rejected
outright
by
the
president.
mcnamara
's
recommendations
amounted
to
his
saying
that
the
strategy
of
the
united
states
in
vietnam
which
had
been
pursued
to
date
had
failed.
mcnamara
later
stated
he
``
never
heard
back
''
from
johnson
regarding
the
memo.
largely
as
a
result
,
on
november
<integer>
of
that
year
,
mcnamara
announced
his
pending
resignation
and
that
he
would
become
president
of
the
world
bank.
other
factors
were
the
increasing
intensity
of
the
anti-war
movement
in
the
u.s.
,
the
approaching
presidential
campaign
in
which
johnson
was
expected
to
seek
re-election
,
and
mcnamara
's
support—over
the
objections
of
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
,
of
construction
along
the
<integer>th
parallel
separating
south
and
north
vietnam
of
a
line
of
fortifications
running
from
the
coast
of
vietnam
into
laos.
the
president
's
announcement
of
mcnamara
's
move
to
the
world
bank
stressed
his
stated
interest
in
the
job
and
that
he
deserved
a
change
after
seven
years
as
secretary
of
defense
(
longer
than
any
of
his
predecessors
or
successors
)
.
others
give
a
different
view
of
mcnamara
's
departure
from
office.
for
example
,
stanley
karnow
in
his
book
vietnam
:
a
history
strongly
suggests
that
mcnamara
was
asked
to
leave
by
the
president.
the
historian
arthur
schlesinger
,
jr
stated
that
he
was
present
during
a
conversation
between
mcnamara
and
senator
kennedy
during
which
the
former
told
the
latter
that
he
only
learned
from
reading
the
newspapers
of
johnson
's
announcement
that
he
had
just
``
resigned
''
as
defense
secretary
and
had
been
appointed
president
of
the
world
bank.
mcnamara
himself
expressed
uncertainty
about
the
question.
on
<day>
,
a
story
in
the
financial
times
of
london
based
on
leaked
sources
in
washington
stated
mcnamara
was
going
to
be
the
next
world
bank
president
,
which
came
as
a
considerable
surprise
to
mcnamara.
afterwards
,
mcnamara
met
with
kennedy
who
told
him
to
resign
in
protest
and
denounce
the
war
as
unwinnable
,
counsel
that
mcnamara
rejected
,
saying
that
johnson
had
been
a
friend
and
that
he
was
still
loyal
to
him.
when
mcnamara
refused
to
resign
,
kennedy
told
him
that
he
should
turn
down
the
world
bank
presidency
and
join
him
in
criticizing
the
war
,
which
mcnamara
refused
to
do.
johnson
knew
that
mcnamara
was
concerned
about
poverty
in
the
third
world
,
and
that
the
possibility
of
serving
as
world
bank
president
would
be
too
tempting
for
mcnamara
to
resist.mcnamara
left
office
on
february
<integer>
,
<year>
;
for
his
efforts
,
the
president
awarded
him
both
the
medal
of
freedom
and
the
distinguished
service
medal.
mcnamara
's
last
day
as
defense
secretary
was
a
memorable
one.
the
hawkish
national
security
adviser
,
walt
whitman
rostow
,
argued
at
a
cabinet
meeting
that
day
that
the
united
states
was
on
the
verge
of
winning
the
war.
rostow
urged
johnson
to
send
<integer>
,
<integer>
more
american
troops
to
south
vietnam
to
join
the
half-million
already
there
and
to
drastically
increase
the
number
of
bombing
raids
on
north
vietnam.
at
that
point
,
mcnamara
snapped
in
fury
at
rostow
,
saying
:
``
what
then
?
this
goddamned
bombing
campaign
,
it
's
worth
nothing
,
it
's
done
nothing
,
they
dropped
more
bombs
than
on
all
of
europe
in
all
of
world
war
ii
and
it
has
n't
done
a
fucking
thing
!
''
mcnamara
then
broke
down
in
tears
,
saying
to
johnson
to
just
accept
that
the
war
could
not
be
won
and
stop
listening
to
rostow.
henry
mcpherson
,
an
aide
to
the
president
,
recalled
the
scene
:
``
he
reeled
off
the
familiar
statistics-how
we
had
dropped
more
bombs
on
vietnam
than
on
all
of
europe
during
world
war
ii.
then
his
voice
broke
,
and
there
were
tears
on
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
of
the
futility
,
the
crushing
futility
of
the
air
war.
the
rest
of
us
sat
silently-i
for
one
with
my
mouth
open
,
listening
to
the
secretary
of
defense
talk
that
way
about
a
campaign
for
which
he
had
,
ultimately
,
been
responsible.
i
was
pretty
shocked
''
.
shortly
after
mcnamara
departed
the
pentagon
,
he
published
the
essence
of
security
,
discussing
various
aspects
of
his
tenure
and
position
on
basic
national
security
issues.
he
did
not
speak
out
again
on
defense
issues
or
vietnam
until
after
he
left
the
world
bank.

in

mcnamara

senator
robert
kennedy
entered
the

kennedy
asked
mcnamara
to
tape
a
statement
praising
his
leadership
during
the
cuban
missile
crisis
with
the
understanding
that
the
statement
was
meant
for
a
tv
ad.
mcnamara
praised
kennedy
's
``
shrewd
diplomacy
''
,
saying
he
had
``
remained
calm
and
cool
,
firm
,
but
restrained
,
never
nettled
and
never
rattled
''
.
though
this
was
a
violation
of
world
bank
rules
,
mcnamara
felt
guilty
over
refusing
kennedy
's
requests
to
resign
and
decline
the
world
bank
presidency.
he
was
attacked
for
the
tape
with
the
new

in
an
editorial
lambasting
him
for
his
``
poor

in

bank
,
he
introduced
key
changes
,
most
notably
,
shifting
the
bank
's
economic
development
policies
toward
targeted
poverty
reduction.
prior
to
his
tenure
at
the
world
bank
,
poverty
did
not
receive
substantial
attention
as
part
of
international
and
national
economic
development
;
the
focus
of
development
had
been
on
industrialization
and
infrastructure.
poverty
also
came
to
be
redefined
as
a
condition
faced
by
people
rather
than
countries.
according
to
martha
finnemore
,
the
world
bank
under
mcnamara
's
tenure
``
sold
''
states

``
through

in

,
and

projects.
he
also
instituted
new
methods
of
evaluating
the

one
notable
project
started
during

was
the

mcnamara
visited
santiago
to
meet

to
discuss
the

policy
of
nationalization

especially
of
the
copper
mining
companies.
mcnamara
's
son
,
craig
mcnamara
was
living
in
chile
at
the
time
,
but
the
two
did
not
meet
owning
to
the
rift
over
the
vietnam
war.
mcnamara
files
stated
in
<year>
:
``
i
think
my
father
truly
respected
allende-his
compassion
,
his
humility.
but
he
disapproved
of
the
nationalizations

the
meeting
with
allende
concluded
with
mcnamara
ending
all

loans
to

on

overthrown

agreed
to

,
who
was
visiting

telling
his

call
:
``
you

mcnamara
fils
feels
that
his
father
's
claim
that
he
had
to
cease
loans
to
chile
because
the
allende
government

nationalization
policy
was

human

under
pinochet
were
a
``

that
was
outside

disingenuous
and
dishonest.
craig

he
was
captain
of
the
basketball
team

he
also
took
part
in
varsity
baseball
,
football
,
and
track.
he
also
worked
at
a
cafe
on
campus
to
help
support
himself.
sperry
was
an
english
major
,
but
he
took
an
intro
to
psychology
class
taught
by
a
professor
named
r.
h.
stetson
who
had
worked
with
william
james
,
the
father
of
american
psychology.
this
class
sparked
sperry
's
interest
in
the
brain
and
how
it
can
change.
stetson
was
disabled
and
had
trouble
getting
around
so
sperry
would
help
him
out
by
driving
him
to
and
from
wherever
he
needed
to
go.
this
included
taking
stetson
to
lunch
with
his
colleagues.
sperry
would
just
sit
at
the
end
of
the
table
and
listen
to
stetson
and
his
colleagues
discuss
their
research
and
other
psychological
interests.
this
increased
sperry
's
interest
in
psychology
even
more
and
after
he
received
his
undergraduate
degree
in
english
from
oberlin
he
decided
to
stay
and
get
his
master
's
degree
in
psychology.
he
received
his
bachelor

then
a

there
he
focused
on
experiments

sperry
went

became
an
associate
professor
of
psychology.
he
was
not

move
to

maryland
but
was
held
up
by
a

during
this
time
sperry
's
friend
victor
hepburn
invited
him
to
lecture
about
his
research
at
a
symposium.
there
were
professors
from
the
california
institute
of
technology
in
the
audience
of
the
symposium
who
,
after
listening
to
sperry
's
lecture
,
were
so
impressed
with
him
they
offered
him
a
job
as
the
hixson
professor
of
psychobiology.
in
<year>
,
he
accepted
the
position
as
a
professor
at
the
california
institute
of
technology
(
caltech
as
hixson
professor

psychobiology
)
where
he
performed
his
most
famous
experiments
with
joseph

and
many
students
including
michael
gazzaniga.
under
the
supervision
of
paul
weiss
while
earning
his
ph.d.
at
the
university
of
chicago
,
sperry
became
interested
in
neuronal
specificity
and
brain
circuitry
and
began
questioning
the
existing
concepts
about
these
two
topics.
he
asked
the
simple
question
first
asked
in
his
introduction
to
psychology
class
at
oberlin
:
nature
or
nurture
?
he
began
a
series
of
experiments
in
an
attempt
to
answer
this
question.
sperry
crosswired
the
motor
nerves
of
rats
'
legs
so
the
left
nerve
controlled
the
right
leg
and
vice
versa.
he
would
then
place
the
rats
in
a
cage
that
had
an
electric
grid
on
the
bottom
separated
into
four
sections.
each
leg
of
the
rat
was
placed
into
one
of
the
four
sections
of
the
electric
grid.
a
shock
was
administered
to
a
specific
section
of
the
grid
,
for
example
the
grid
where
the
rat
's
left
back
leg
was
located
would
receive
a
shock.
every
time
the
left
paw
was
shocked
the
rat
would
lift
his
right
paw
and
vice
versa.
sperry
wanted
to
know
how
long
it
would
take
the
rat
to
realize
he
was
lifting
the
wrong
paw.
after
repeated
tests
sperry
found
that
the
rats
never
learned
to
lift
up
the
correct
paw
,
leading
him
to
the
conclusion
that
some
things
are
just
hardwired
and
can
not
be
relearned.
in
sperry
's
words
,
``
no
adaptive
functioning
of
the
nervous
system
took
place.
''
during
sperry
's
postdoctoral
years
with
karl
lashley
at
harvard
and
at
the
yerkes
laboratories
of
primate
biology
in
orange
park
,
florida
,
he
continued
his
work
on
neuronal
specificity
that
he
had
begun
as
a
doctoral
student
and
initiated
a
new
series
of
studies
involving
salamanders.
the
optic
nerves
were
sectioned
and
the
eyes
rotated
<integer>
degrees.
the
question
was
whether
vision
would
be
normal
after
regeneration
or
would
the
animal
forever
view
the
world
as
``
upside
down
''
and
right-left
reversed.
should
the
latter
prove
to
be
the
case
,
it
would
mean
that
the
nerves
were
somehow
``
guided
''
back
to
their
original
sites
of
termination.
restoration
of
normal
vision
(
i.e.
,
``
seeing
''
the
world
in
a
``
right-side-up
''
orientation
)
would
mean
that
the
regenerating
nerves
had
terminated
in
new
sites
,
quite
different
from
the
original
ones.
the
animals
reacted
as
though
the
world
was
upside
down
and
reversed
from
right
to
left.
furthermore
,
no
amount
of
training
could
change
the
response.
these
studies
,
which
provided
strong
evidence
for
nerve
guidance
by
``
intricate
chemical
codes
under
genetic
control
''
(
<year>
)
culminated
in
sperry
's
chemoaffinity
hypothesis
(
<year>
)
.sperry
later
served
on
the
board
of
trustees
and
as
professor
of
psychobiology
emeritus
at
california
institute
of
technology.
the
sperry
neuroscience
building
at
oberlin
college
was
named
in
his
honor
in
<year>.
==
nobel
prize
==
sperry
was
granted
numerous
awards
over
his
lifetime
,
including
the
california

award
in

the
national

the

prize
for

in
<year>
that
he
shared
with
david
h.
hubel
and
torsten
n.
wiesel.
sperry
won
this
award
for
his
work
with
``
split-brain
''
patients.
the
brain
is
divided
into
two
hemispheres
,
the
left
and
right
hemispheres
,
connected
in
the
middle
by
a
part
of
the
brain
called
the
corpus
callosum.
in
``
split-brain
''
patients
,
the
corpus
callosum
has
been
severed
due
to
the
patients
suffering
from
epilepsy
,
a
disease
that
causes
intense
and
persistent
seizures.
seizures
begin
in
one
hemisphere
and
continue
into
the
other
hemisphere.
cutting
the
corpus
callosum
prevents
the
seizures
from
moving
from
one
hemisphere
to
the
other
,
which
then
prevents
seizures
from
occurring
,
thus
allowing
the
patients
to
function
normally
instead
of
suffering
from
continuous
seizures.
sperry
first
became
interested
in
``
split-brain
''
research
when
he
was
working
on
the
topic
of
interocular
transfer
,
which
occurs
when
``
one
learns
with
one
eye
how
to
solve
a
problem
then
,
with
that
eye
covered
and
using
the
other
eye
,
one
already
knows
how
to
solve
the
problem
''
.
sperry
asked
the
question
:
``
how
can
the
learning
with
one
eye
appear
with
the
use
of
the
other
?
''
sperry
cut
nerves
in
the
eyes
of
cats
so
the
left
eye
was
connected
to
the
left
hemisphere
and
the
right
eye
was
connected
to
the
right
hemisphere
;
he
also
cut
the
corpus
callosum.
the
cats
were
then
taught
to
distinguish
a
triangle
from
a
square
with
the
right
eye
covered.
then
the
cats
were
presented
the
same
problem
with
the
left
eye
covered
;
the
cats
had
no
idea
what
they
had
just
learned
with
the
right
eye
and
because
of
this
could
be
taught
to
distinguish
a
square
from
a
triangle.
depending
on
which
eye
was
covered
,
the
cats
would
either
distinguish
a
square
from
a
triangle
or
a
triangle
from
a
square
,
demonstrating
that
the
left
and
right
hemispheres
learned
and
remembered
two
different
events.
this
led
sperry
to
believe
that
the
left
and
right
hemispheres
function
separately
when
not
connected
by
the
corpus
callosum.
sperry
's
research
with
``
split-brain
''
cats
helped
lead
to
the
discovery
that
cutting
the
corpus
callosum
is
a
very
effective
treatment
for
patients
who
suffer
from
epilepsy.
initially
after
the
patients
recovered
from
surgery
there
were
no
signs
that
the
surgery
caused
any
changes
to
their
behavior
or
functioning.
this
observation
rendered
the
question
:
if
the
surgery
had
absolutely
no
effect
on
any
part
of
the
patients
'
normal
functioning
then
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
corpus
callosum
?
was
it
simply
there
to
keep
the
two
sides
of
the
brain
from
collapsing
,
as
karl
lashley
jokingly
put
it
?
sperry
was
asked
to
develop
a
series
of
tests
to
perform
on
the
``
split-brain
''
patients
to
determine
if
the
surgery
caused
changes
in
the
patients
'
functioning
or
not.
working
with
his
graduate
student
michael
gazzaniga
,
sperry
invited
several
of
the
``
split-brain
''
patients
to
volunteer
to
take
part
in
his
study
to
determine
if
the
surgery
affected
their
functioning.
these
tests
were
designed
to
test
the
patients
'
language
,
vision
,
and
motor
skills.
when
a
person
views
something
in
the
left
visual
field
(
that
is
on
the
left
side
of
their
body
)
,
the
information
travels
to
the
right
hemisphere
of
the
brain
and
vice
versa.
in
the
first
series
of
tests
,
sperry
would
present
a
word
to
either
the
left
or
right
visual
field
for
a
short
period
of
time.
if
the
word
was
shown
to
the
right
visual
field
,
meaning
the
left
hemisphere
would
process
it
,
then
the
patient
could
report
seeing
the
word.
if
the
word
was
shown
to
the
left
visual
field
,
meaning
the
right
hemisphere
would
process
it
,
then
the
patient
could
not
report
seeing
the
word.
this
led
sperry
to
believe
that
only
the
left
side
of
the
brain
could
articulate
speech.
however
,
in
a
follow-up
experiment
,
sperry
discovered
that
the
right
hemisphere
does
have
some
language
abilities.
in
this
experiment
,
he
had
the
patients
place
their
left
hands
in
a
tray
full
of
objects
located
under
a
partition
so
the
patient
would
not
be
able
to
see
the
objects.
then
a
word
was
shown
to
the
patient
's
left
visual
field
,
which
was
processed
by
the
right
side
of
the
brain.
this
word
described
one
of
the
objects
in
the
tray
,
so
the
patient
's
left
hand
picked
up
the
object
corresponding
to
the
word.
when
participants
were
asked
about
the
word
and
the
object
in
their
hand
,
they
claimed
they
had
not
seen
the
word
and
had
no
idea
why
they
were
holding
the
object.
the
right
side
of
the
brain
had
recognized
the
word
and
told
the
left
hand
to
pick
it
up
,
but
because
the
right
side
of
the
brain
can
not
speak
and
the
left
side
of
the
brain
had
not
seen
the
word
,
the
patient
could
not
articulate
what
they
had
seen.
in
another
series
of
experiments
further
examining
the
lateralization
of
language
in
the
left
and
right
hemispheres
,
sperry
presented
one
object
to
the
left
visual
field
and
a
different
object
to
the
right
visual
field
of
the
``
split-brain
''
patients.
the
patient
's
left
hand
was
put
under
a
partition
and
then
the
patient
was
asked
to
draw
with
their
left
hand
what
they
had
been
shown.
the
patients
would
draw
what
they
had
seen
in
their
left
visual
field
,
but
when
asked
what
they
had
drawn
would
describe
what
had
been
shown
to
their
right
visual
field.
these
tests
proved
that
when
the
corpus
callosum
is
severed
,
it
breaks
the
connection
between
the
left
and
right
hemispheres
,
making
them
unable
to
communicate
with
each
other.
not
only
are
they
unable
to
communicate
with
each
other
,
but
also
without
the
corpus
callosum
connecting
them
one
hemisphere
has
no
idea
that
the
other
hemisphere
even
exists.
there
was
even
evidence
of
this
outside
the
laboratory
when
some
of
the
patients
reported
that
,
``
while
their
left
hand
was
unbuttoning
their
shirt
,
the
right
hand
would
follow
along
behind
and
button
it
again.
''
these
experiments
were
beneficial
to
numerous
people
in
many
different
ways.
in
his
words
,
each
hemisphere
is
:
indeed
a
conscious
system
in
its
own
right
,
perceiving
,
thinking
,
remembering
,
reasoning
,
willing
,
and
emoting
,
all
at
a
characteristically
human
level
,
and
...
both
the
left
and
the
right
hemisphere
may
be
conscious
simultaneously
in
different
,
even
in
mutually
conflicting
,
mental
experiences
that
run
along
in
parallel
this
research
contributed
greatly
to
understanding
the
lateralization
of
brain
function.
in
<year>
,
sperry
also
received
the
national
medal
of
science.
afterwards
in
<year>
,
sperry
received
the
lifetime
achievement
award
from
apa.
in
addition
to
his
contribution
in
establishing
the
lateralized
function
of
the
brain
,
sperry
is
noted
for
his
``
chemoaffinity
hypothesis
''
,
which
has
not
only
been
influential
in
formation
of
testable
hypotheses
in
how
precise
neuronal
wiring
diagram
is
established
in
the
brain
,
but
the
hypothesis
itself
has
been
verified
by
numerous
experiments.
the
cells
and
fibers
of
the
brain
must
carry
some
kind
of
individual
identification
tags
,
presumably
cytochemical
in
nature
,
by
which
they
are
distinguished
one
from
another
almost
,
in
many
regions
,
to
the
level
of
the
single
neurons
in
the
words
of
a
<year>
review
article
in
science
magazine
:
``
he
suggested
that
gradients
of
such
identification
tags
on
retinal
neurons
and
on
the
target
cells
in
the
brain
coordinately
guide
the
orderly
projection
of
millions
of
developing
retinal
axons.
this
idea
was
supported
by
the
identification
and
genetic
analysis
of
axon
guidance
molecules
,
including
those
that
direct
development
of
the
vertebrate
visual
system.
''
this
was
confirmed
in
the
seventies
by
marshall
w.
nirenberg
's
work
on
chick
retinas
and
later
on
drosophila
melanogaster
larvae.the
experiments
conducted
by
sperry
focused
on
four
major
ideas
which
were
also
called
``
turnarounds
''
:
equipotentiality
,
split
brain
studies
,
nerve
regeneration
and
plasticity
,
and
psychology
of

contributions
to
economic
science
==
mincer
was
considered
by
many
to
be
a
father
of
modern
labor
economics.
as
a
leading
member
of
a
group
of
economists
known
as
the
chicago
school
of
economics
,
mincer
and
nobel
laureate
gary
becker
helped
to
develop
the
empirical
foundations
of
human
capital
theory
,
consequently
revolutionizing
the
field
of
labor
economics.
during
his
academic
career
,
mincer
authored
four
books
and
hundreds
of
journal
articles
,
papers
and
essays.
mincer
's
ground-breaking
work
:
schooling
,
experience
and
earnings
,
published
in
<year>
,
used
data
from
the
<year>
and
<year>
censuses
to
relate
income
distribution
in
america
to
the
varying
amounts
of
education
and
on-the-job
training
among
workers.
``
he
calculated
,
for
example
,
that
annual
earnings
rose
by
<integer>
to
<integer>
percent
in
the
<year>s
and
<year>s
for
every
year
of
additional
schooling.
there
was
a
similar
,
although
smaller
,
return
on
investment
in
job
training—and
age
played
a
role.
''
mincer
's
work
continues
to
have
a
profound
impact
on
the
field
of
labor
economics.
papers
in
the
field
frequently
use
mincerian
equations
,
which
model
wages
as
a
function
of
human
capital
in
statistical
estimation.
and
as
a
result
of
mincer
's
pioneering
work
,
variables
such
as
schooling
and
work
experience
are
now
the
most
commonly
used
measures
of
human
capital.

==
in
<year>
mincer
was
elected
as
a
fellow
of
the
american
statistical
association.in
<year>
,
he
received
an
honorary
doctor
of
laws
degree
from
the
university
of
chicago
which
recognized
his
seminal
work
in
the
economic
analysis
of
earnings
and
inequality
,
the
labor
force
decisions
of
women
and
of
job

the
citation
for
the
degree
also
recognized
mincer
's
work
in
this
area
that
has
helped
guide
a
generation
of
economists
who
study
these
important
social
questions.
in
recognition
of
his
lifetime
achievements
in
economics
,
mincer
was
awarded
the
first
iza
prize
in
labor
economics
of
the
institute
for
the
study
of
labor
(
bonn
,

)
.
the

<integer>
prize
was
presented
to
mincer
by
more
than
<integer>
of
his
former
students
and
colleagues
at
a
conference
at
columbia
university
in
<year>.
in
<year>
mincer
received
a
career
achievement
award
from
the
society
of
labor
economists
;
the
annual
award
has
subsequently
become
known
as
the
mincer
award.
mincer
was
never
awarded
a
nobel
prize
,
though
he
was
considered
one
of
the
world
's
greatest
economists
of
the

and
was
nominated
for
the

quotes
regarding
mincer
==
..the
decade
jacob
and
i
spent
working
together
was
surely
one
of
the
most
,
if
not
the
most
exciting
and
fruitful
in
my
life.
the
close
blending
of
theory
and
data
represented
in
mincer
's
work
has
shaped
the
direction
of
labor
economics
and
influenced
and
inspired
all
those
who
have
followed
him.
his
very
simple
formulation
basically
fits
the
data
for
understanding
how
earnings
are
related
to
educational
attainment
in
virtually
every
country
in
every
time
period.

life
==
aschoff
was
born
in
freiburg
im
breisgau
as
the
fifth
child
of
the
pathologist
ludwig
aschoff
(
known
for
discovering
the
aschoff-tawara
or
atrioventricular
node
)
and
his
wife
clara.
he
grew
up
in
the
liberal
but
morally
strict
world
of
prussian
academia.
after
the
abitur
at
a
humanistic
high
school
,
he
–
according
to
his
own
statement
``
lacking
a
specific
interest
''
–
studied
medicine
at
the
university
of
bonn
,
where
he
joined
the
burschenschaft
(
fraternity
)
alemannia
bonn.
aschoff’s
scientific
career
began
in
<year>
,
when
he
moved
to
the
university
of
göttingen
to
study
thermoregulation
physiology
with
hermann
rein.
in
<year>
,
he
received
the
venia
legendi.
he
then
became
a
professor
at
the
university
of
göttingen
in
<year>.in
<year>
,
his
mentor
,
hermann
rein
,
was
appointed
director
of
the
max
planck
institute
for
medical
research
in
heidelberg.
rein
brought
aschoff
to
the
institute
as
a
collaborator
to
study
circadian
rhythms
in
humans
,
birds
,
and
mice.
aschoff
then
moved
to
the
max
planck
institute
for
behavioral
physiology
in
andechs
to
work
with
gustav
kramer
,
who
showed
time-compensated
sun-compass
navigation
in
birds
,
and
erich
von
holst
,
who
studied
physiological
oscillators.
from
<year>
to
<year>
,
he
was
a
director
at
the
max
planck
institute
for
behavioral
physiology
and
an
extraordinary
professor
in
munich.
aschoff
was
a
scientific

and
a
member
of

institute
for
behavior
physiology
,
as
well
as
senator
of

society
from
<year>
to

aschoff
was
known
as
an
excellent
lecturer
with
a
booming
voice
,
and
he
took
a
special
interest
in
creating
a
scientific
community
and
encouraging
young
scientists.
after
his
retirement
in
<year>
and
return
to
freiburg
,
aschoff
continued
his
scientific
work
in
the
form
of
further
publications.
only
the
death
of
his
wife
hilde
broke
his
unusual
vitality.

,
after
a
short
illness
at
the
age

years.
==
work
==
aschoff
provided
a
strong
foundation
for
the
field
of
chronobiology
through
his
research
on
circadian
rhythms
and
entrainment
in
many
different
organisms
such
as
rats
,
mice
,
birds
,
macaques
,
monkeys
,
and
humans.
his
early
research
focused
on
understanding
the
properties
of
circadian
rhythms
and
how
these
rhythms
can
change
in
response
to
stimuli.
his
later
work
was
more
applicable
to
pathologies
,
such
as
psychiatric
disorders
and
dangers
of
shift
work
schedules
,
which
can
result
from
manipulating
specific
zeitgebers.
aschoff
's
work
in
the
field
of
chronobiology
introduced
the
idea
that
shifting
one
's
light-dark
cycle
can
result
in
harmful
effects
,
such
as
correlations
with
mental
illness.
===
early
work
===
aschoff
began
his
research
on
the
physiology
of
thermoregulation
by
self-experimentation.
he
discovered
that
there
was
a
<integer>-hour
rhythm
of
variation
in
body
temperature.
after
these
experiments
,
he
began
investigating
the
basic
mechanisms
of
circadian
rhythm.
in
the
<year>s
,
he
met
and
began
to
collaborate
with
erwin
bünning
and
colin
pittendrigh.
aschoff
began
further
experimentation
studying
the
circadian
rhythms
of
birds
and
mice
under
constant
conditions.
his
results
led
to
the
conclusion
that
circadian
oscillations
of
biological
processes
were
innate
and
did
not
require
prior
exposure
to
a
<integer>-hour
day
to
be
expressed.aschoff
also
applied
these
methods
to
experiments
with
human
circadian
rhythms
by
building
an
underground
``
bunker
''
to
isolate
human
subjects
from
any
external
environmental
cues.
subjects
placed
in
this
bunker
were
allowed
to
turn
lights
on
or
off
according
to
their
own
internal
rhythms.
after
over
twenty
years
of
tracking
sleep-wake
cycles
,
body
temperature
,
urine
output
,
and
other
physiological
and
behavioral
outputs
,
aschoff
and
his
collaborator
rütger
wever
concluded
that
humans
have
endogenous
circadian
oscillators.
this
discovery
has
become
the
foundation
for
our
understanding
of
many
medical
problems
such
as
aging
,
sleep
disorders
,
and
jet
lag.in
<year>
,
aschoff
coined
the
term
zeitgeber
(
from
german
for
``
time
giver
''
or
``
synchronizer
''
)
to
refer
to
external
,
environmental
cues
that
synchronize
an
endogenous
oscillator
to
the
environmental
cycle.
to
investigate
the
properties
of
natural
endogenous
oscillators
,
aschoff
exposed
organisms
to
constant
conditions
without
zeitgeber
cues
(
either
constant
light
or
constant
darkness
)
.
the
observations
from
this
paper
were
formulated
into
the
fundamental
rules
of
biological
clocks.
===
aschoff
's
rule
===
from
the
experiments
communicated
in
<year>
,
aschoff
noted
that
under
constant
light
conditions
,
the
activity
phase
shortens
in
nocturnal
organisms
and
lengthens
in
diurnal
organisms.
these
trends
were
termed
alpha
compression
and
alpha
expansion
,
respectively.
in
tribute
to
his
mentor
,
pittendrigh
called
this
observation
``
aschoff
's
rule
''
in
a
<year>
publication
,
and
the
designation
remains
today.aschoff
's
rule
is
related
to
the
model
of
parametric
entrainment
,
which
assumes
continuous
phase
changes.
aschoff
and
pittendrigh
approached
the
field
with
different
models
of
how
oscillators
entrain
,
which
resulted
in
different
predictive
models.
aschoff
's
parametric
model
states
that
entrainment
occurs
through
gradual
changes
in
the
clock
that
adapt
to
a
new
light-dark
cycle.
although
this
is
no
longer
recognized
as
the
correct
model
in
the
field
,
serge
daan
suggested
in
<year>
that
aschoff
made
qualitative
contributions
that
provide
valuable
alternatives
to
inconsistencies
in
the
current
field.

work

rather
,
knowing
the
time
of
day
from
social
cues
,
such
as
regular
meal
times
,
is
sufficient
for
entrainment.
aschoff
also
found
that
different
circadian
outputs
such
as
body
temperature
and
locomotor
activity
can
be
either
internally
synchronized
or
desynchronized
depending
on
the
strength
of
the
zeitgeber.
in
constant
darkness
,
rectal
temperature
and
sleep
onset
and
duration
became
desynchronized
in
some
subjects
,
and
the
rectal
temperature
at
the
time
of
sleep
onset
was
correlated
to
the
duration
of
the
bout
of
sleep.
he
hypothesized
that
internal
desynchronization
,
the
phase
differences
resulting
from
period
differences
between
two
circadian
output
processes
,
could
be
related
to
many
psychiatric
disorders.some
of
aschoff
's
later
work
also
integrated
his
initial
interest
in
thermoregulation
with
his
work
on
circadian
rhythm.
he
found
a
circadian
rhythm
in
thermal
conductance
,
a
measurement
of
heat
transfer
from
the
body.
minimal
conductance
in
mammals
and
birds
oscillates
with
circadian
phase
,
with
a
wide
range
of
conductance
values.
this
allows
animals
to
release
heat
during
their
activity
period
,
when
they
have
higher
basal
metabolism
,
as
well
as
conserve
heat
during
their
rest
period
,
when
they
have
lower
basal
metabolism.
in
birds
,
the
circadian
rhythm
in
conductance
results
mostly
from
circadian
rates
of
evaporative
heat
loss.
in
mammals
,
the
conductance
oscillates
with
circadian
rhythms
in
the
body
's
heat
resistance
and
blood
flow
rate.following
up
on
his
temperature
studies
,
he
found
that
a
mammalian
species
can
entrain
to
a
temperature
cycle
,
but
that
temperature
is
a
weak
zeitgeber
compared
to
a
light-dark
cycle.aschoff
described
masking
signals
as
inputs
that
circumvent
the
pacemaker
but
nevertheless
lead
to
modulation
of
a
circadian
behavior
that
is
also
controlled
by
the
pacemaker.
parametric
entrainment
is
entrainment
that
does
not
result
from
an
instant
change
in
phase
,
as
governed
by
a
phase
response
curve
,
as
in
the
case
of
masking
signals.
the
term
aschoff
used
for
this
phenomenon
is
“arousal”
due
to
non-photic
zeitgebers.
data
from
experimental
assays
show
a
relationship
between
masking
effects
and
phase
,
leading
to
a
“demasking”
effect
whereby
animals
arrhythmic
in
constant
conditions
have
free-running
periods
in
high
frequency
light-dark
cycles.
aschoff
concluded
that
the
oscillator
or
circadian
clock
“integrates”
over
the
intensity
of
light
to
which
it
has
been
exposed
,
and
then
responds
with
a
change
in
the
period
of
activity
,
as
seen
in
greenfinches
,
chaffinches
,
hamsters
,
and
siskins.
aschoff
concluded
,
however
,
that
non-parametric
effects
,
as
opposed
to
parametric
effects
,
are
the
principal
source
of
entrainment.

===
kantrowitz
limit
===
kantrowitz
is
known
for
development
of
a
theoretical
concept
of
fluid
choke
points
at
supersonic
and
near-supersonic
inlet
velocities.
the
concept
has
become
known
as
the
kantrowitz
limit.
====
technical
description
====
====
applications
====
the
kantrowitz
limit
has
many
applications
in
the
gas
dynamics
of
inlet
flow
for
jet
engines
and
rockets
,
both
when
operating
at
high-subsonic
and
supersonic
velocities.
two
examples
will
explain
the
effect
of
the
kantrowitz
limit
on
a
nozzle.
for
both
cases
,
mass
flow
rate
=
inlet
velocity
multiplied
by
area
multiplied
by
density.
consider
a
nozzle
connected
to
a
vacuum
source.
as
the
pressure
ratio
gets
to
about
<integer>
,
the
flow
through
the
nozzle
will
approach
the
local
speed
of
sound
,
and
the
flow
becomes
choked
flow.
when
the
absolute
pressure
of
the
vacuum
is
decreased
further
,
the
flow
speed
will
not
increase.
this
is
the
kantrowitz
limit
,
which
limits
the
mass
flow
because
the
velocity
is
limited
to
the
speed
of
sound
,
and
the
area
,
inlet
pressure
and
density
are
all
fixed.
aircraft
jet
engines
are
very
much
affected
by
this
limit
,
once
the
inlet
flow
speed
gets
to
mach
<integer>
the
mass
flow
rate
is
limited
,
regardless
of
how
much
suction
the
engine
creates.
next
,
consider
the
nozzle
connected
to
a
compressed
air
supply.
with
a
pressure
ratio
of
about
<integer>
,
the
flow
becomes
choked
,
and
can
not
exceed
the
speed
of
sound.
but
the
density
and
resultant
mass
flow
rate
can
be
increased
by
increasing
the
inlet
pressure.
the
greater
the
pressure
,
the
greater
the
density
,
and
the
greater
the
mass
flow.
so
,
while
kantrowitz
limits
the
maximum
gas
velocity
,
it
does
not
apply
any
fixed
limit
to
the
mass
flow
rate.
a
recent
high-speed
transportation
option
for
rapid
transit
between
populous
city-pairs
about
<integer>
,
<integer>
miles
(
<integer>
,
<integer>
km
)
apart
,
the
hyperloop
,
has
the
kantrowitz
limit
as
a
fundamental
design
criterion.
attempting
to
pass
a
high-speed
passenger-pod
through
a
very
low
pressure
tube
runs
squarely
into
the
kantrowitz
fluid
flow
limit.
historically
,
the
solutions
to
working
within
the
limit
have
been
``
go
fast
''
and
``
go
slow
''
.
a
major
innovation
in
the
hyperloop
proposal
provides
a
novel
third
approach
to
remain
below
the
kantrowitz
limit
while
still
moving
at
high-subsonic
velocities
:
adding
a
front-end
inlet
compressor
to
actively
transfer
high-pressure
air
from
the
front
to
the
rear
of
the
high-speed
transport
capsule
,
and
thus
bypassing
much
of
the
air
that
would
have
resulted
in
the
dynamic
shock
of
the
choked
flow.
the
flow
in
the
smaller
duct
through
the
capsule
is
also
subject
to
the
kantrowitz
limit
,
this
is
relieved
by
increasing
the
pressure
and
the
density
to
achieve
the
required
mass
flow.
in
the
hyperloop
alpha
design
of
<year>
,
the
air-inlet
pump
also
provides
a
low-friction
air-bearing
suspension
system
for
traveling

over
<integer>

(

<integer>

a

his

===
operations
research
===
russell
ackoff
started
his
career
in
operations
research
at
the
end
of
the
<year>s.
his
<year>
book
introduction
to
operations
research
,
co-authored
with
c.
west
churchman
and
leonard
arnoff
,
was
one
of
the
first
publications
that
helped
define
the
field.
the
influence
of
this
work
,
according
to
kirby
and
rosenhead
(
<year>
)
,
``
on
the
early
development
of
the
discipline
in
the
usa
and
in
britain
in
the
<year>s
and
<year>s
is
hard
to
over-estimate
''
.in
the
<year>s
ackoff
became
one
of
the
most
important
critics
of
the
so-called
``
technique-dominated
operations
research
''
,
and
starting
proposing
more
participative
approaches.
his
critiques
,
according
to
kirby
and
rosenhead
(
<year>
)
,
``
had
little
resonance
within
the
usa
,
but
were
picked
up
both
in
britain
,
where
they
helped
to
stimulate
the
growth
of
problem
structuring
methods
,
and
in
the
systems
community
world-wide
''
,
such
as
soft
systems
methodology
from
peter
checkland.
===
purposeful
systems
===
in
<year>
ackoff
wrote
a
book
with
frederick
edmund
emery
about
purposeful
systems
,
which
focused
on
the
question
how
systems
thinking
relates
to
human
behaviour.
``
individual
systems
are
purposive
''
,
they
said
,
``
knowledge
and
understanding
of
their
aims
can
only
be
gained
by
taking
into
account
the
mechanisms
of
social
,
cultural
,
and
psychological
systems
''
.any
human-created
systems
can
be
characterized
as
``
purposeful
system
''
when
its
``
members
are
also
purposeful
individuals
who
intentionally
and
collectively
formulate
objectives
and
are
parts
of
larger
purposeful
systems
''
.
other
characteristics
are
:
``
a
purposeful
system
or
individual
is
ideal-seeking
if
...
it
chooses
another
objective
that
more
closely
approximates
its
ideal
''
.
``
an
ideal-seeking
system
or
individual
is
necessarily
one
that
is
purposeful
,
but
not
all
purposeful
entities
seek
ideals
''
,
and
``
the
capability
of
seeking
ideals
may
well
be
a
characteristic
that
distinguishes
man
from
anything
he
can
make
,
including
computers
''
.according
to
kirby
and
rosenhead
(
<year>
)
,
``
the
fact
that
these
systems
were
experiencing
profound
change
could
be
attributed
to
the
end
of
the
``
machine
age
''
and
the
onset
of
the
``
systems
age
''
.
the
machine
age
,
bequeathed
by
the
industrial
revolution
,
was
underpinned
by
two
concepts
–
reductionism
(
everything
can
in
the
end
be
decomposed
into
indivisible
parts
)
and
mechanism
(
cause-effect
relationships
)
''
.
hereby
``
all
phenomena
were
believed
to
be
explained
by
using
only
one
ultimately
simple
relationship
,
cause-effect
''
,
which
in
the
systems
age
are
replaced
by
expansionism
and
teleology
with
producer-product
replacing
cause-effect.
``
expansionism
is
a
doctrine
maintaining
that
all
objects
and
events
,
and
all
experiences
of
them
,
are
parts
of
larger
wholes.
''
according
to
ackoff
,
``
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
the
machine
age
and
the
beginning
of
the
systems
age
could
be
dated
to
the
<year>s
,
a
decade
when
philosophers
,
mathematicians
,
and
biologists
,
building
on
developments
in
the
interwar
period
,
defined
a
new
intellectual
framework
''
.
===
f-laws
===
in
<year>
,
ackoff
worked
with
herbert
j.
addison
and
sally
bibb.
they
developed
the
term
f-law
to
describe
a
series
of
over
<integer>
distilled
observations
of
bad
leadership
and
the
misplaced
wisdom
that
often

the
common
flaws
in
both
the
practice
of
leadership
and
in
the
established
beliefs
that
surround
it.
according
to
ackoff
``
f-laws
are
truths
about
organizations
that
we
might
wish
to
deny
or
ignore
–
simple
and
more
reliable
guides
to
managers
'
everyday
behavior
than
the
complex
truths
proposed
by
scientists

===
relationship
to
peter
drucker
===
russell
ackoff
was
friends
with
peter
drucker
from
the
earliest
days
of
their
careers.
mr.
drucker
acknowledged
the
early
,
critical
contribution
ackoff
made
to
his
work
–
and
the
world
of
management
in
general
–
in
the
following
letter
,
which
was
delivered
to
ackoff
by
former
general
motors
v.p.
vince
barabba
on
the
occasion
of
the
<integer>rd
international
conference
on
systems
thinking
in
management
(
icstm
)
held
at
the
university
of
pennsylvania
,
may
<integer>–<integer>
,
<year>
:
i
was
then
,
as
you
may
recall
,
one
of
the
early
ones
who
applied
operations
research
and
the
new
methods
of
quantitative
analysis
to
specific
business
problems—rather
than
,
as
they
had
been
originally
developed
for
,
to
military
or
scientific
problems.
i
had
led
teams
applying
the
new
methodology
in
two
of
the
world’s
largest
companies—ge
and
at
&
t.
we
had
successfully
solved
several
major
production
and
technical
problems
for
these
companies—and
my
clients
were
highly
satisfied.
but
i
was
not—we
had
solved
technical
problems
but
our
work
had
no
impact
on
the
organizations
and
on
their
mindsets.
on
the
contrary
:
we
had
all
but
convinced
the
managements
of
these
two
big
companies
that
quantitative
manipulation
was
a
substitute
for
thinking.
and
then
your
work
and
your
example
showed
us—or
at
least
,
it
showed
me—that
the
quantitative
analysis
comes
after
the
thinking—it
validates
the
thinking
;
it
shows
up
intellectual
sloppiness
and
uncritical
reliance
on
precedent
,
on
untested
assumptions
and
on
the
seemingly
“obvious.”
but
it
does
not
substitute
for
hard
,
rigorous
,
intellectually
challenging
thinking.
it
demands
it
,
though—but
does
not
replace
it.
this
is
,
of
course
,
what
you
mean
by
system.
and
your
work
in
those
far-away
days
thus
saved
me—as
it
saved
countless
others—from
either
descending
into
mindless
“model
building”
–
the
disease
that
all
but
destroyed
so
many
of
the
business
schools
in
the
last
decades—or
from
sloppiness
parading
as
‘insight.’

james
callaghan
,
baron
callaghan
of
cardiff
,
(
;
<day>
–
<day>
)
,
commonly
known
as
jim
callaghan
,
was
a
british
politician
who
served
as
prime
minister
of
the
united
kingdom
from
<year>
to
<year>
and
leader
of
the
labour
party
from
<year>
to
<year>.
callaghan
is
the
only
person
to
have
held
all
four
great
offices
of
state
,
having
served
as
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
from
<year>
to
<year>
,
home
secretary
from
<year>
to
<year>
and
foreign
secretary
from
<year>
to
<year>.
he
was
a
member
of
parliament
(
mp
)
from
<year>
to
<year>.
born
into
a
working
class
family
in
portsmouth
,
callaghan
left
school
early
and
began
his
career
as
a
tax
inspector
,
before
becoming
a
trade
union
official
in
the
<year>s
;
he
served
as
a
lieutenant
in
the
royal
navy
during
the
second
world
war.
he
was
elected
to
parliament
at
the
<year>
election
,
and
was
regarded
as
being
on
the
left
wing
of
the
labour
party.
he
was
appointed
to
the
attlee
government
as
a
parliamentary
secretary
in
<year>
,
and
began
to
move
increasingly
towards
the
right
wing
of
the
labour
party
,
while
maintaining
his
reputation
as
a
``
keeper
of
the
cloth
cap
''
–
that
is
,
seen
as
maintaining
close
ties
between
labour
and
the
trade
unions.
following
labour
's
defeat
at
the
<year>
election
,
callaghan
increasingly
became
regarded
as
the
leader
of
the
right
wing
of
the
labour
party
,
and
stood
for
the
positions
of
deputy
leader
in
<year>
and
for
leader
in
<year>
,
but
was
defeated
by
george
brown
for
the
former
and
harold
wilson
for
the
latter.
following
labour
's
victory
at
the
<year>
election
,
wilson
appointed
callaghan
as
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
;
this
appointment
coincided
with
a
turbulent
period
for
the
british
economy
,
during
which
callaghan
had
to
tackle
both
a
chronic
balance
of
payments
deficit
and
various
speculative
attacks
on
the
pound
sterling
,
with
its
exchange
rate
to
other
currencies
being
fixed
by
the
bretton
woods
system.
on
<day>
,
having
initially
denied
that
it
would
do
so
,
the
government
devalued
the
pound
sterling.
in
the
wake
of
the
decision
,
wilson
moved
callaghan
to
the
role
of
home
secretary.
during
this
time
,
callaghan
was
responsible
for
overseeing
the
operations
of
the
british
army
to
support
the
police
in
northern
ireland
,
following
a
request
from
the
northern
ireland
government.
callaghan
remained
in
the
shadow
cabinet
during
labour
's
period
in
opposition
from
<year>
to
<year>
;
upon
labour
's
victory
at
the
<year>
election
,
wilson
appointed
callaghan
as
foreign
secretary.
callaghan
was
responsible
for
renegotiating
the
terms
of
britain
's
membership
of
the
european
communities
(
ec
)
,
and
strongly
supported
the
``
yes
''
vote
campaign
in
the
<year>
referendum
,
which
confirmed
the
uk
's
membership
of
the
ec.
when
wilson
suddenly
announced
his
retirement
in
march
<year>
,
callaghan
defeated
five
other
candidates
to
be
elected
leader
of
the
labour
party
;
he
was
appointed
prime
minister
on
<day>.
despite
winning
a
narrow
majority
in
the
house
of
commons
at
the
<year>
election
,
labour
had
lost
this
by
the
time
callaghan
became
prime
minister
,
and
several
by-election
defeats
and
defections
in
his
early
months
forced
callaghan
to
strike
a
confidence
and
supply
agreement
with
the
liberal
party.
while
this
initially
proved
stable
,
in
the
wake
of
significant
industrial
disputes
and
widespread
strikes
in
the
<year>–<integer>
``
winter
of
discontent
''
,
and
the
defeat
of
the
referendum
on
devolution
for
scotland
,
led
to
minor
parties
joining
the
conservatives
to
pass
a
motion
of
no-confidence
in
callaghan
on
<day>.
although
remaining
personally
popular
in
opinion
polls
,
callaghan
led
labour
to
defeat
at
the
<year>
election
and
was
replaced
by
margaret
thatcher.
callaghan
initially
remained
as
labour
leader
,
serving
as
leader
of
the
opposition
until
november
<year>.
he
attempted
to
reform
the
process
by
which
labour
elected
its
leader.
after
leaving
the
leadership
,
he
returned
to
the
backbench
,
and
between
<year>
and
<year>
was
father
of
the
house
of
commons.
on
retiring
from
the
commons
in
<year>
,
he
was
elevated
to
the
house
of
lords
as
baron
callaghan
of
cardiff.
he
died
on
<day>
and
remains
to
date
the
uk
's
longest-lived
former
prime
minister.

an

sir
alec
douglas-home
(
who
had
only
been
in
power
for
twelve
months
since
the
resignation
of

)
was
forced
to
call
a

election
,
the

being
about

labour
won
a
narrow
majority
,
gaining
<integer>
seats
for
a
total
of
<integer>
to
the
conservatives
'
<integer>.
the
new
labour
government
under
harold
wilson
immediately
faced
economic
problems
;
wilson
acted
within
his
first
hours
to
appoint
callaghan
as
the
new
chancellor
of
the
exchequer.
the
previous
chancellor
,
reginald
maudling
,
had
initiated
fiscally
expansionary
measures
which
had
helped
create
a
pre-election
economic
boom
;
by
greatly
increasing
domestic
demand
this
had
caused
imports
to
grow
much
faster
than
exports
,
thus
when
labour
entered
government
they
faced
a
balance
of
payments
deficit
of
£<integer>
,
<integer>
,
<integer>
(
equivalent
to
£<integer>
,
<integer>
,
<integer>
,
<day>
)
,
and
an
immediate
sterling
crisis.
both
wilson
and
callaghan
took
a
strong
stance
against
devaluation
of
sterling
,
partly
due
to
the
perception
that
the
devaluation
carried
out
by
the
previous
labour
government
in
<year>
had
contributed
to
that
government
's
downfall.
the
alternative
to
devaluation
,
however
,
was
a
series
of
austerity
measures
designed
to
reduce
demand
in
the
economy
in
order
to
reduce
imports
,
and
to
stabilise
the
balance
of
payments
and
the
value
of
sterling.
just
ten
days
after
taking
up
his
post
,
callaghan
immediately
introduced
a
<integer>
%
surcharge
on
imports
,
with
the
exception
of
foodstuffs
and
raw
materials.
this
measure
was
intended
to
tackle
the
balance
of
payments
deficit
;
however
,
it
caused
an
uproar
amongst
britain
's
international
trading
partners.
the
outcry
was
so
intense
that
it
caused
the
government
to
announce
that
the
surcharge
was
a
temporary
measure.
callaghan
later
admitted
in
his
autobiography
that
he
could
have
handled
the
matter
better
,
and
in
his
haste
to
tackle
the
balance
of
payments
problem
,
had
failed
to
consult
foreign
governments.on
<integer>
november
,
callaghan
gave
his
first
budget
and
announced
increases
in
income
tax
,
petrol
tax
and
the
introduction
of
a
new
capital
gains
tax
,
actions
which
most
economists
deemed
necessary
to
take
the
heat
out
of
the
balance
and
sterling
deficit.
in
line
with
labour
's
manifesto
commitments
,
the
budget
also
contained
social
measures
to
increase
the
state
pension
and
the
widows
pension
;
measures
which
were
disliked
by
the
city
and
speculators
,
causing
a
run
on
the
pound.
on
<integer>
november
,
it
was
decided
to
increase
the
bank
rate
from
<integer>
%
to
<integer>
%
,
which
generated
a
large
amount
of
criticism.
handling
the
situation
was
made
more
difficult
by
the
attitude
of
lord
cromer
,
the
governor
of
the
bank
of
england
,
who
argued
against
the
fiscal
policies
of
the
new
labour
government.
when
callaghan
and
wilson
threatened
to
call
a
new
general
election
,
the
governor
soon
raised
a
£<integer>
,
<integer>
,
<integer>
,
<integer>
loan
to
stabilise
the
reserves
and
the
deficit.his
second
budget
came
on
<day>
,
in
which
he
announced
efforts
to
deflate
the
economy
and
reduce
home
import
demand
by
£<integer>
,
<integer>
,
<integer>.
shortly
afterwards
,
the
bank
rate
was
reduced
from
<integer>
%
down
to
<integer>
%
.
for
a
brief
time
,
the
economy
and
british
financial
market
stabilised
,
allowing
in
june
for
callaghan
to
visit
the
united
states
and
to
discuss
the
state
of
the
british
economy
with
president
lyndon
b.
johnson
and
the
international
monetary
fund
(
imf
)
.in
july
,
the
pound
came
under
extreme
pressure
and
callaghan
was
forced
to
create
harsh
temporary
measures
to
demonstrate
control
of
the
economy.
these
include
delaying
all
current
government
building
projects
and
postponing
new
pension
plans.
the
alternative
was
to
allow
the
pound
to
float
or
to
devalue
it.
callaghan
and
wilson
,
however
,
were
again
adamant
that
a
devaluation
of
the
pound
would
create
new
social
and
economic
problems
and
continued
to
take
a
firm
stance
against
it.
the
government
continued
to
struggle
both
with
the
economy
and
with
the
slender
majority
which
,
by
<year>
,
had
been
reduced
to
one.
on
<integer>
february
,
harold
wilson
formally
announced
an
election
for
<day>.
on
<integer>
march
,
callaghan
gave
a
'little
budget
'
to
the
commons
and
announced
the
historic
decision
that
the
uk
would
adopt
decimal
currency.
(
it
was
actually
not
until
<year>
,
under
a
conservative
government
,
that
the
united
kingdom
moved
from
the
system
of
pounds
,
shillings
and
pence
to
a
decimal
system
of
<integer>
pence
to
the
pound.
)
he
also
announced
a
short-term
mortgage
scheme
which
allowed
low-wage
earners
to
maintain
mortgage
schemes
in
the
face
of
economic
difficulties.
soon
afterwards
,
at
the
<year>
general
election
,
labour
won
<integer>
seats
compared
to
<integer>
seats
against
the
conservatives
,
giving
the
labour
government
an
increased
majority
of
<integer>
seats.callaghan
introduced
his
next
budget
on
<integer>
may.
he
had
informed
the
house
that
he
would
bring
a
full
budget
to
the
house
when
he
made
his
'little
budget
'
speech
prior
to
the
election.
the
main
point
of
his
budget
was
the
introduction
of
a
selective
employment
tax
,
penalising
the
service
industry
and
favouring
the
manufacturing
industry.
twelve
days
after
the
budget
,
the
national
union
of
seamen
called
a
national
strike
and
the
problems
facing
sterling
were
multiplied.
additional
strikes
caused
the
balance
of
payments
deficit
to
increase.
however
,
a
£<integer>
,
<integer>
,
<integer>
,
<integer>
loan
from
swiss
banks
was
due
by
the
end
of
the
year.
on
<integer>
july
,
the
bank
rate
was
increased
again
to
seven
percent
,
and
on
<integer>
july
callaghan
announced
a
ten-point
emergency
package
to
deal
with
the
crisis
which
included
further
tax
rises
and
a
six-month
freeze
on
wage
increases.
by
early
<year>
,
the
economy
had
begun
to
stabilise
once
again
with
the
balance
of
payments
moving
into
equilibrium
,
the
bank
rate
was
reduced
to
<integer>
%
in
march
and
<decimal>
%
in
may.it
was
under
these
conditions
that
callaghan
beat
michael
foot
in
a
vote
to
become
treasurer
of
the
labour
party.
the
economy
was
soon
in
turmoil
again
by
june
,
with
the
six-day
war
in
the
middle
east.
several
arab
countries
,
such
as
kuwait
and
iraq
,
announced
an
oil
embargo
against
britain
,
accusing
it
of
intervening
on
the
israeli
side
in
the
conflict
,
resulting
in
a
rise
in
oil
prices
which
had
a
disastrous
effect
on
the
balance
of
payments.
furthermore
,
the
economy
was
hit
in
mid-september
when
a
national
dock
strike
lasted
for
eight
weeks.
the
final
straw
,
however
,
was
an
eec
report
which
suggested
that
the
pound
could
not
be
sustained
as
a
reserve
currency
and
it
was
suggested
again
that
the
pound
should
be
devalued.
callaghan
responded
by
pointing
out
that
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
middle
east
crisis
,
britain
would
have
been
heading
for
a
balance
of
payments
surplus
in
<year>.
however
,
rumours
that
devaluation
was
on
the
cards
led
to
heavy
selling
of
sterling
on
world
markets.
wilson
and
callaghan
refused
a
contingency
fund
offered
from
the
imf
because
of
several
conditions
attached
which
they
believed
would
allow
the
imf
to
interfere
with
economic
policy.
on
<day>
<integer>
november
,
the
historic
decision
was
taken
to
commit
the
government
to
a
<decimal>
%
devaluation
from
the
existing
fixed
exchange
rate
of
$
<decimal>
to
the
pound
,
to
$
<decimal>
to
the
pound.
they
intended
to
announce
the
decision
publicly
on
the
<integer>th.
however
,
in
the
run
up
to
the
public
announcement
,
callaghan
found
himself
in
a
tricky
situation
when
answering
questions
in
the
house
of
commons
:
one
backbencher
robert
sheldon
tabled
a
motion
concerning
a
rumour
that
britain
would
be
receiving
a
loan
from
banks.
callaghan
did
not
wish
to
lie
to
the
commons
,
but
at
the
same
time
going
public
about
the
devaluation
decision
before
the
<integer>th
would
be
financially
disastrous
for
the
country.
he
answered
the
initial
question
by
stating
that
he
did
not
comment
on
rumours.
however
a
follow
up
question
was
made
by
stan
orme
suggesting
that
devaluation
was
preferable
to
deflation
,
which
caused
a
major
problem.
callaghan
replied
that
he
had
``
nothing
to
add
or
subtract
from
,
anything
i
have
said
on
previous
occasions
on
the
subject
of
devaluation
''
...
speculators
seized
on
the
fact
that
he
had
not
denied
there
would
be
a
devaluation
and
started
selling
sterling.
over
the
next
<integer>
hours
,
the
flight
from
sterling
cost
the
country
£<integer>
,
<integer>
million.
the
situation
was
a
great
political
controversy
at
the
time.
as
denis
healey
in
his
autobiography
notes
:
nowadays
exchange
rates
can
swing
to
and
fro

callaghan

he
said
the

and
he
told
a

:
``
public

callaghan
,
a

to
barbara

's
white
paper
``

which
sought

amongst

numerous
proposals
were
plans
to
force

held
and
the
establishment
of
an
industrial
board
to

,
many
of

following
wilson

at
the
<year>

,
callaghan
declined
to
challenge
him

despite
wilson
's
vulnerability.
this
did
much
to

which
contained
the

to
ensure
that

barely
two
years
after
beginning
his
second
spell
as
prime
minister
,
wilson
announced
his
surprise
resignation
on
<day>
,
and
unofficially
endorsed
callaghan
as
his
successor.
callaghan
was
the
favourite
to
win
the
leadership
election
;
although
he
was
the
oldest
candidate
,
he
was
also
the
most
experienced
and
least
divisive.
popularity
with
all
parts
of
the
labour
movement
saw
him
through
the
ballot
of
labour
mps
to
win
the
leadership
vote.
on
<day>
,
at
the
age
of
<integer>
years
and
<integer>
days
,
callaghan
became
prime
minister—the
oldest
prime
minister
at
time
of
appointment
since
winston
churchill.
==
prime
minister
of
the
united
kingdom
:
<year>–<year>
==
callaghan
was
the
only
prime
minister
to
have
held
all
three
leading
cabinet
positions—chancellor
of
the
exchequer
,
home
secretary
and
foreign
secretary—prior
to
becoming
prime
minister.
during
his
first
year
in
office
,
callaghan
started
what
has
since
become
known
as
'the
great
debate
'
,
when
he
spoke
at
ruskin
college
,
oxford
,
about
the
'legitimate
concerns
'
of
the
public
about
the
quality
of
education
in
the
nation
's
maintained
schools.
this
discussion
led
to
greater
involvement
of
the
government
,
through
its
ministries
,
in
the
curriculum
and
administration
of
state
education
,
leading
to
the
eventual
introduction
of
the
national
curriculum
some
ten
years
later.
early
in
his
premiership
he
caused
controversy
with
the
appointment
of
peter
jay
,
his
then
son-in-law
as
the
british
ambassador
to
the
united
states.
callaghan
's
time
as
prime
minister
was
dominated
by
the
troubles
in
running
a
government
with
a
minority
in
the
house
of
commons
:
he
was
forced
to
make
deals
with
minor
parties
to
survive—including
the
lib–lab
pact
,
and
he
had
been
forced
to
accept
a
referendum
on
devolution
in
scotland
as
well
as
one
in
wales
(
the
former
went
in
favour
but
did
not
reach
the
required
majority
,
and
the
latter
went
heavily
against
)
.
he
also
became
prime
minister
at
a
time
when
britain
was
suffering
from
double-digit
percentage
inflation
and
rising
unemployment.
he
responded
to
the
economic
crises
by
adopting
deflationary
policies
to
reduce
inflation
,
and
cutting
public
expenditure—a
precursor
to
the
monetarist
economic
policies
that
the
next
government
,
a
conservative
one
led
by
margaret
thatcher
,
would
pursue
to
ease
the
crises.despite
the
economic
difficulties
faced
by
the
government
,
over
the
summer
of
<year>
(
shortly
after
the
end
of
the
lib-lab
pact
)
most
opinion
polls
showed
labour
ahead
,
and
the
expectation
grew
that
callaghan
would
call
an
autumn
election
that
would
have
given
him
a
second
term
in
office
until
autumn
<year>.
the
economy
had
also
started
to
show
signs
of
recovery
by
this
time.
<year>
was
a
year
of
economic
recovery
for
britain
,
with
inflation
falling
to
single
digits
,
unemployment
declining
during
the
year
,
and
general
living
standards
going
up
by
more
than
<integer>
%
.
famously
,
he
strung
along
the
opposition
and
was
expected
to
make
his
declaration
of
election
in
a
broadcast
on
<day>.
his
decision
to
put
off
the
election
was
seen
by
many
at
the
time
as
a
sign
of
his
domination
of
the
political
scene
and
he
ridiculed
his
opponents
by
singing
old-time
music
hall
star
vesta
victoria
's
song
``
waiting
at
the
church
''
at
that

trades
union
congress
meeting.
this
was
celebrated
at
the
time
but
has
since
been
interpreted
as
one
of
the
greatest
moments
of
hubris
in
modern
british
politics.
callaghan
intended
to
convey
the
message
that
he
had
not
promised
an
election
,
but
most
observers
misread
his
message
as
an
assertion
that
he
would
call
an
election
,
and
the
conservatives
would
not
be
ready
for
it.
===
winter
of
discontent
===
callaghan
's
method
of
dealing
with
the
long-term
economic
difficulties
involved
pay
restraint
which
had
been
operating
for
four
years
with
reasonable
success.
he
gambled
that
a
fifth
year
would
further
improve
the
economy
and
allow
him
to
be
re-elected
in
<year>
,
and
so
attempted
to
hold
pay
rises
to
<integer>
%
or
less.
the
trade
unions
rejected
continued
pay
restraint
and
in
a
succession
of
strikes
over
the
winter
of
<year>–<integer>
(
known
as
the
winter
of
discontent
)
secured
higher
pay.
the
industrial
unrest
made
his
government
extremely
unpopular
,
and
callaghan
's
response
to
one
interview
question
only
made
it
worse.
returning
to
the
united
kingdom
from
a
summit
held
in
guadeloupe
in
january
<year>
,
callaghan
was
asked
,
``
what
is
your
general
approach
,
in
view
of
the
mounting
chaos
in
the
country
at
the
moment
?
''
callaghan
replied
,
``
well
,
that
's
a
judgement
that
you
are
making.
i
promise
you
that
if
you
look
at
it
from
outside
,
and
perhaps
you
're
taking
rather
a
parochial
view
at
the
moment
,
i
do
n't
think
that
other
people
in
the
world
would
share
the
view
that
there
is
mounting
chaos.

this
reply
was
reported
in
the
sun
under
the
headline
``

.
callaghan
also
later
admitted
in
regard
to
the
winter
of
discontent
that
he
had
``
let
the
country
down
''
.the
winter
of
discontent
saw
labour
's
performance
in
the
opinion
polls
slump
dramatically.
they
had
topped
most
of
the
pre-winter
opinion
polls
by
several
points
,
but
in
february
<year>
at
least
one
opinion
poll
was
showing
the
tories
<integer>
points
ahead
of
labour
and
it
appeared
certain
that
labour
would
lose
the
forthcoming
election.in
the
buildup
to
the
election
,
the
daily
mirror
and
the
guardian
supported
labour
,
while
the
sun
,
the
daily
mail
,
the
daily
express
,
and
the
daily
telegraph
supported
the
conservatives.
on
<day>
,
the
house
of
commons
passed
a
motion
of
no-confidence
by
one
vote
,
<integer>–<integer>
,
which
forced
callaghan
to
call
a
general
election
that
was
held
on
<integer>
may.
the
conservatives
under
margaret
thatcher
ran
a
campaign
on
the
slogan
``
labour
is
n't
working
''
and
won
the
election.
callaghan
agreed
to
a
proposal
by
brian
walden
,
a
former
labour
mp
who
was
by
then
a
broadcaster
,
to
take
part
in
two
televised
debates
with
margaret
thatcher
to
be
produced
by
lwt
with
the
intention
that
they
would
be
broadcast
on

<day>.
at
the
insistence
of
the
liberal
party
,
their
leader
david
steel
was
also
invited
to
take
participate
in
the
prosed
debates
,
and
he
also
quickly
accepted
the
offer.
however
mrs
thatcher
ultimately
rejected
the
approach
to
take
part
in
the
debates
,
citing
among
other
reasons
her
belief
that
the
election
was
for
a
government
,
not
a
president.
her
refusal
meant
that
the
debates
did
not
go
ahead.callaghan
's
failure
to
call
an
election
during
<year>
was
widely
seen
as
a
political
miscalculation
;
indeed
,
he
himself
later
admitted
that
not
calling
an
election
was
an
error
of
judgement.
however
,
private
polling
by
the
labour
party
in
the
autumn
of
<year>
had
shown
the
two
main
parties
with
about
the
same
level
of
support.
after
losing
power
in
<year>
,
labour
spent
the
next
<integer>
years
in
opposition.
historians
alan
sked
and
chris
cook
have
summarised
the
general
consensus
of
historians
regarding
labour
in
power
in
the
<year>s
:
if
wilson
's
record
as
prime
minister
was
soon
felt
to
have
been
one
of
failure
,
that
sense
of
failure
was
powerfully
reinforced
by
callaghan
's
term
as
premier.
labour
,
it
seemed
,
was
incapable
of
positive
achievements.
it
was
unable
to
control
inflation
,
unable
to
control
the
unions
,
unable
to
solve
the
irish
problem
,
unable
to
solve
the
rhodesian
question
,
unable
to
secure
its
proposals
for
welsh
and
scottish
devolution
,
unable
to
reach
a
popular
modus
vivendi
with
the
common
market
,
unable
even
to
maintain
itself
in
power
until
it
could
go
to
the
country
and
the
date
of
its
own
choosing.
it
was
little
wonder
,
therefore
,
that
mrs
thatcher
resoundingly
defeated
it
in
<year>.

he
would
be
willing
to
become
more
active
in
the
party.
according
to
benn
:
one
young
woman
in
her
mid-twenties
rang
up
jim
callaghan
and
said
to
him
on
the
phone
,
``
have
you
ever
thought
of
being
a
bit
more
active
in
politics
?
''
so
callaghan
said
,
``
well
i
was
a
labour
prime
minister
–
what
more
could
i
do
?
''
during
an
interview
broadcast
on
the
bbc
radio
<integer>
programme
the
human
button
,
callaghan
became
the
only
prime
minister
to
go
on
record
with
his
opinion
on
ordering
a
retaliation
in
the
event
of
a
nuclear
attack
on
the
united
kingdom
:
''
if
it
were
to
become
necessary
or
vital
,
it
would
have
meant
the
deterrent
had
failed
,
because
the
value
of
the
nuclear
weapon
is
frankly
only
as
a
deterrent
''
,
he
said.
``
but
if
we
had
got
to
that
point
,
where
it
was
,
i
felt
,
necessary
to
do
it
,
then
i
would
have
done
it.
i
've
had
terrible
doubts
,
of
course
,
about
this.
i
say
to
you
,
if
i
had
lived
after
having
pressed
that
button
,
i
could
never
,
ever
have
forgiven
myself.
''
in
october
<year>
,
callaghan
told
the
oldie
magazine
that
he
would
not
be
surprised
to
be
considered
as
britain
's
worst
prime
minister
in
<integer>
years.
he
also
said
in
this
interview
that
he
``
must
carry
the
can
''
for
the

and
settled
in

there
is
much
doubt
about
how
much
belief
callaghan
retained
into
adult
life
,
the
baptist
nonconformist
ethic
was
a
profound
influence
throughout
all
of
his
public
and
private
life.
like
his
labour
party
leader
successors
michael
foot
and
neil
kinnock
,
callaghan
was
acknowledged
to
have
been
an
atheist
,
and
was
said
to
have
lost
belief
in
god
while
he
was
working
as
a
trade
union
official.one
of
his
final
public
appearances
came
on

when
shortly

he
sat

at

of
lobar
pneumonia
,
cardiac
failure
and
kidney
failure
,
the
day
before

he
died
just
<integer>
days
after
his
wife
of
<integer>

,
who
had
spent
the
last
four
years
of
her
life
in
a
nursing
home
due
to
alzheimer
's
disease.
he
died
as
britain
's
longest-lived
former
prime
minister
,
having
surpassed
harold
macmillan
's
record
<integer>
days
earlier.lord
callaghan
was
cremated
,
and
his
ashes
were
scattered
in
a
flowerbed
around
the
base
of
the
peter
pan
statue
near
the
entrance
of
london
's
great
ormond
street
hospital
,
where
his
wife
had
formerly
been
chair
of
the
board
of
governors.his
order
of
the
garter
banner
was
transferred
from
st
george
's
chapel
,
windsor
castle
to
llandaff
cathedral
in
cardiff
following
his
death.
==
historiography
==
his
contribution
and
legacy
are
still
contested.
the
left-wing
of
the
labour
party
considers
him
a
traitor
whose
betrayals
of
true
socialism
laid
the
foundations
for
thatcherism.
they
point
to
his
decision
in
<year>
to
allow
the
imf
to
control
the
government
budget.
they
accuse
him
of
abandoning
the
traditional
labour
commitment
to
full
employment.
they
blame
his
rigorous
pursuit
of
a
policy
of
controlling
income
growth
for
the
winter
of
discontent.
writers
on
the
right
of
the
labour
party
complained
that
he
was
a
weak
leader
who
was
unable
to
stand
up
to
the
left.
the
new
labour
writers
who
admire
tony
blair
identify
him
with
the
old-style
partisanship
that
was
a
dead
end
which
a
new
generation
of
modernisers
had
to
repudiate.practically
all
commentators
agree
that
callaghan
made
a
serious
mistake
by
not
calling
an
election
in
the
autumn
of
<year>.
bernard
donoughue
,
a
senior
official
in
his
government
,
depicts
callaghan
as
a
strong
and
efficient
administrator
who
stood
heads
above
his
predecessor
harold
wilson.
the
standard
scholarly
biography
by
kenneth
o.
morgan
is
generally
favourable—at
least
for
the
middle
of
his
premiership—while
admitting
failures
at
the
beginning
,
at
the
end
and
in
his
leadership
role
following
margaret
thatcher
's
victory.
the
treatment
found
in
most
textbooks
and
surveys
of
the
period
remains
largely
negative.

membership
in

party
==
after
rett
's
death
,
he
received
criticism
for

no
evidence
rett

george
goodwin
cmg
frs
(
<day>
–
<day>
)
was
a
british
protozoologist
noted
for
his
work
on
testing
the
effectiveness
of
chemical
compounds
in
treating
tropical
diseases.
he
was
born
in
london
to
a
shoe
shop
manager
,
and
became
interested
in
nature
thanks
to
holidays
spent
with
his
grandfather
,
a
gamekeeper
,
and
his
uncle
,
a
pharmacist.
he
was
educated
at
william
ellis
school
before
being
accepted
into
university
college
london
to
study
botany
and
zoology.
after
graduating
he
went
to
the
college
of
the
pharmaceutical
society
and
studied
pharmacy
,
graduating
in
<year>.
he
became
a
demonstrator
at
the
college
under
j
h
burn
and
at
his
urging
took
further
degrees
in
medicine
and
physiology.
the
start
of
world
war
ii
saw
the
college
evacuated
,
leaving
goodwin
to
find
a
new
job.
he
started
work
at
the
wellcome
bureau
of
scientific
research
but
was
called
up
for
military
service
with
the
royal
tank
regiment
soon
afterwards.
after
only
a
few
days
of
training
he
was
returned
to
wellcome
to
work
on
tropical
diseases
,
something
considered
'vital
war
work
'
which
excused
him
from
military
service.
one
of
the
important
problems
he
was
dealing
with
at
the
time
was
trying
to
find
a
way
of
preventing
troops
being
infected
with
leishmaniasis
,
which
was
affecting
large
numbers
of
troops
in
sicily
at
the
time.
the
standard
way
of
calculating
the
dosage
of
drug
to
give
a
person
was
the
'chemotherapeutic
index
'
,
an
index
between
the
minimum
dosage
to
cure
an
infection
and
the
point
at
which
the
drug
would
kill
the
patient.
goodwin
's
attempt
at
refining
the
index
by
testing
the
drugs
on
european
hamsters
failed
because
they
were
already
resistant
to
leishmaniasis
;
instead
he
got
a
scientist
in
jerusalem
to
send
him
some
syrian
hamsters
to
test
the
drugs
on.the
research
showed
that
pentostam
was
the
least
toxic
and
most
effective
drug
available
to
treat
the
disease
,
and
it
was
issued
to
troops
within
a
year.
goodwin
later
claimed
that
the
syrian
hamsters
used
as
pets
in
the
united
kingdom
were
for
the
most
part
descended
from
the
colony
he
had
bred
,
and
credited
himself
with
introducing
the
use
of
hamsters
as
pets.
he
continued
working
at
the
wellcome
bureau
of
scientific
research
until
<year>

when
he
became
director
of

in

laboratories
for

on

other
members
of
schürer
's
team
of
economic
experts
included
ernst
höfner
and
alexander
schalck-golodkowski.
the
report
comprised
an
``

democratic
republic

with

''
(
``

.
it
had
been
commissioned
by
the
newly
appointed
party
secretary
egon
krenz
,
for
presentation
to
the
politburo.
the
analysis
disclosed
a
catastrophic
picture.
the
east
german
economy
was
over-indebted
and
had
for
years
``
been
consuming
itself
''
(
``
zehrt
seit

von

''
)
.
a
far
reaching
economic
reform
programme
was
proposed
,
but
in
the
view
of
the
authors
that
would
not
be
enough
to
avert
looming
national
insolvency.
the
only
remaining
hope
was
massive
additional
loans
from
the
german
federal
republic
(

strongly
in

street
protesters
breached
the
berlin
wall
in
november
<year>
and
it
became
clear
that
soviet
troops
had
no
instructions
to
re-enact
the
brutal
suppression
of
<year>
or
<year>.
as
further
changes
unfolded
during
<year>/<integer>
it
turned
out
that
the
economic
solution
for
the
country
would
arrive
not
in
the
form
of
massive
additional
loans
from
the
west
,
but
as
part
of
german
reunification
,
which
was
formally
enacted
in
october
<year>.
donda
successfully
led
the
successful
transition
of
the
east
german
statistical
authority
towards
integration
with
its
formerly
west
german
counterpart.
till

he
held

however

his

accomplished
the
ministry

informed
him
that

it
was
not
an
unusual
experience
after

a
sense

is
evident

zvi
griliches
(
gril-i-kəs
;
<day>
–
<day>
)
was
an
economist
at
harvard
university.
the
works
by
zvi
griliches
mostly
concerned
the
economics
of
technological
change
,
including
empirical
studies
of
diffusion
of
innovations
and
the
role
of
r
&
d
,
patents
,
and
education.
==
biography
==
he
was
born
in
kaunas
,
lithuania
in
an
assimilated
jewish
family
that
spoke
russian
at
home.
during
world
war
ii
he
was
sent
to
the
dachau
concentration
camp.
in
<year>
he
emigrated
to
palestine
,
where
he
served
in
the
pre-state
israeli
army
,
learned
hebrew
,
passed
high
school
equivalence
exam
,
and
studied
for
a
year
at
hebrew
university.
he
then
moved
to
the
united
states
,
where
he
earned
a
b.s.
in
agricultural
economics
from
the
university
of
california
,
berkeley
,
and
then
a
ph.d.
in
economics
at
the
university
of
chicago
,
supervised
by
theodore
schultz.
in
his
classic
<year>
ph.d.
dissertation
,
hybrid
corn
:
an
exploration
in
the
economics
of
technological
change
,
published
as
an
article
in
the
october
<year>
issue
of
econometrica
,
griliches
demonstrated
that
the
penetration
of
corn
seeds
followed
the
logistic
curve.
it
was
found
later
through
multiple
examples
by
edwin
mansfield
and
other
researchers
that
this
is
a
general
rule
for
technological
change
/
diffusion
of
innovations.
the
dissertation
was
one
of
the
first
scientific
works
that
treated
the
development
of
new
technology
as
an
economic
phenomenon.
previously
,
economists
had
treated
it
as
exogenous.
most
innovations
either
make
production
more
efficient
,
or
improve
the
quality
of
goods.
the
analysis
of
measurement
of
the
impact
of
innovations
on
economics
led
griliches
to
his
fundamental
studies
of
economic
growth
,
productivity
,
production
function
,
consumption
function
,
measurements
of
economic
input
and
output
,
hedonic
prices
,
and
their
reflection
in
price
indices.
griliches
also
published
important
works
of
econometrics
,
including
distributed
lags
(
time
series
)
and
aggregation.
he
was
particularly
interested
in
the
measurements
of
hidden
variables.
griliches
served
as
the
president
of
the
econometric
society
in
<year>
,
and
as
the
president
of
the
american
economic
association
in
<year>.
from
<year>
to
<year>
he
was
one
of
editors
of
the
journal
econometrica.
he
served
on
the
stigler
commission
in
<year>
and
the
boskin
commission
in
<year>
,
both
of
which
were
convened
by
the
united
states
senate
to
evaluate
the
measurement
of
inflation.
in
<year>
,
zvi
griliches
won
the
prestigious
john
bates
clark
medal.
he
was
elected
to
the
american
academy
of
arts
and
sciences
in
<year>
and
to
the
national
academy
of
sciences
in

was
a
leading
american
economist
of

,
and
an
influential
adviser
to
president
john
f.
kennedy
as
chairman
of
the
council
of

,
<year>–<integer>.
==
life
and
career

heller
was
born
in
buffalo
,
new
york
,
to
german
immigrants
,
gertrude
(
warmburg
)
and
ernst
heller
,
a
civil
engineer.
after
attending
shorewood
high
school
in
shorewood
,
wisconsin
,
he
entered
oberlin
college
in
<year>
,
graduating
with
a
b.a.
degree
in
<year>.
heller
received
his
masters
and
doctorate
degrees
in
economics
from
the
university
of
wisconsin.as
a
keynesian
,
he
promoted
cuts
in
the
marginal
federal
income
tax
rates.
this
tax
cut
,
which
was
passed
by
president
lyndon
b.
johnson
and
congress
after
kennedy
's
death
,
was
credited
for
boosting
the
u.s.
economy.
heller
developed
the
first
``
voluntary
''
wage-price
guidelines.
when
the
steel
industry
failed
to
follow
them
,
it
was
publicly
attacked
by
kennedy
and
quickly
complied.
heller
was
one
of
the
first
to
emphasize
that
tax
deductions
and
tax
preferences
narrowed
the
income
tax
base
,
thus
requiring
,
for
a
given
amount
of
revenue
,
higher
marginal
tax
rates.
the
historic
tax
cut
and
its
positive
effect
on
the
economy
has
often
been
cited
as
motivation
for
more
recent
tax
cuts
by
republicans.
the
day
after
kennedy
was
assassinated
,
heller
met
with
president
johnson
in
the
oval
office.
to
get
the
country
going
again
,
heller
suggested
a
major
initiative
he
called
the
``
war
on
poverty
''
,
which
johnson
adopted
enthusiastically.
later
,
when
johnson
insisted
on
escalating
the
vietnam
war
without
raising
taxes
,
setting
the
stage
for
an
inflationary
spiral
,
heller
resigned.
in
the
early
phases
of
his
career
,
heller
contributed
to
the
creation
of
the
marshall
plan
of
<year>
,
and
was
instrumental
in
re-establishing
the
german
currency
following
world
war
ii
,
which
helped
usher
an
economic
boom
in
west
germany.
heller
was
critical
of
milton
friedman
's
followers
and
labelled
them
cultish
:
``
some
of
them
are
friedmanly
,
some
friedmanian
,
some
friedmanesque
,
some
friedmanic
and

and
philosophy

therefore
enrolled

there
,
thanks

popular

and
then
were
published
in

first
in

(
``

or
``

,
from

===
the
basic
laws
of
human
stupidity
(
<year>
)
===
the
second
essay
,
``
the
basic
laws
of
human
stupidity
''
(
``
le
leggi
fondamentali
della
stupidità
umana
''
,
<year>
)
,
explores
the
controversial
subject
of
stupidity.
stupid
people
are
seen
as
a
group
,
more
powerful
by
far
than
major
organizations
such
as
the
mafia
and
the
industrial
complex
,
which
without
regulations
,
leaders
,
or
manifesto
nonetheless
manages
to
operate
to
great
effect
and
with
incredible
coordination.
these
are
cipolla
's
five
fundamental
laws
of
stupidity
:
always
and
inevitably
,
everyone
underestimates
the
number
of
stupid
individuals
in
circulation.
the
probability
that
a
certain
person
(
will
)
be
stupid
is
independent
of
any
other
characteristic
of
that
person.
a
stupid
person
is
a
person
who
causes
losses
to
another
person
or
to
a
group
of
persons
while
himself
deriving
no
gain
and
even
possibly
incurring
losses.
non-stupid
people
always
underestimate
the
damaging
power
of
stupid
individuals.
in
particular
,
non-stupid
people
constantly
forget
that
at
all
times
and
places
,
and
under
any
circumstances
,
to
deal
and/or
associate
with
stupid
people
always
turns
out
to
be
a
costly
mistake.
a
stupid
person
is
the
most
dangerous
type
of
person.corollary
:
a
stupid
person
is
more
dangerous
than
a
pillager.
as
is
evident
from
the
third
law
,
cipolla
identifies
two
factors
to
consider
when
exploring
human
behavior
:
benefits
and
losses
that
an
individual
causes
to
him
or
herself.
benefits

minton
(
october
<integer>
,
<year>
–
april
<integer>
,
<year>
)
was
a
united
states
senator
from
indiana
and
later
an
associate
justice
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
he
was
a
member
of
the
democratic
party.
after
attending
college
and
law
school
,
minton
served
as
a
captain
in
world
war
i
,
following
which
he
launched
a
legal
and
political
career.
in
<year>
,
after
multiple
failed
election
attempts
,
and
serving
as
a
regional
leader
in
the
american
legion
,
he
became
a
utility
commissioner
under
the
administration
of
indiana
governor
paul
v.
mcnutt.
four
years
later
minton
was
elected
to
the
united
states
senate.
during
the
campaign
,
he
defended
new
deal
legislation
in
a
series
of
addresses
in
which
he
suggested
it
was
not
necessary
to
uphold
the
united
states
constitution
during
the
great
depression.
minton
's
campaign
was
denounced
by
his
political
opponents
,
and
he
received
more
widespread
criticism
for
an
address
that
became
known
as
the
``
you
can
not
eat
the
constitution
''
speech.
as
part
of
the
new
deal
coalition
,
minton
championed
president
franklin
d.
roosevelt
's
unsuccessful
court
packing
plans
in
the
senate
and
became
one
of
his
top
senate
allies.
after
minton
failed
in
his
<year>
senate
reelection
bid
,
roosevelt
appointed
him
as
a
united
states
circuit
judge
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
after
roosevelt
's
death
,
president
harry
s.
truman
,
who
had
developed
a
close
friendship
with
minton
during
their
time
together
in
the
senate
,
nominated
him
to
the
supreme
court.
he
was
confirmed
by
the
senate
on
october
<integer>
,
<year>
,
by
a
vote
of
<integer>
to
<integer>
,
<integer>
republicans
and
one
democrat
(
harry
flood
byrd
of
virginia
)
voting
against
him.
he
served
on
the
supreme
court
for
seven
years.
an
advocate
of
judicial
restraint
,
minton
was
a
regular
supporter
of
the
majority
opinions
during
his
early
years
on
the
court
;
he
became
a
regular
dissenter
after
president
dwight
eisenhower
's
appointees
altered
the
court
's
composition.
in
<year>
,
poor
health
forced
minton
to
retire
,
after
which
he
traveled
and
lectured
until
his
death
in
<year>.
according
to
historians
,
minton
's
judicial
philosophy
was
largely
a
reaction
to
the
relationship
between
the
new
deal
senators
and
the
conservative
<year>s
court
,
which
ruled
much
of
the
new
deal
legislation
unconstitutional.
minton
believed
the
supreme
court
should
be
more
deferential
to
the
political
branches
of
government
,
and
supported
a
broad
interpretation
of
the
powers
of
congress.
he
generally
opposed
any
effort
to
rule
federal
legislation
unconstitutional
on
the
principle
that
the
court
was
overstepping
its
authority.
as
a
result
of
his
judicial
philosophy
,
he
sought
to
uphold
the
intent
of
the
political
branches
of
government.
historians
note
the
unusual
contrast
this
created
between
his
role
as
a
partisan
liberal
senator
and
his
role
as
a
conservative
jurist.
when
minton
became
a
justice
,
the
senate
had
become
more
conservative
,
leading
minton
to
uphold
the
constitutionality
and
intention
of
conservative
legislation.
he
often
played
peacemaker
and
consensus
builder
during
a
period
when
the
court
was
riven
by
feuds.
he
generally
ruled
in
favor
of
order
over
freedom
as
a
result
of
his
broad
interpretation
of
governmental
powers.
these
rulings
and
their
limited
impact
gave
some
historians
a
negative
opinion
of
his
judicial
record.
other
historians
consider
minton
's
strong
commitment
to
his
judicial
principles
laudable.
in
<year>
,
the
sherman
minton
bridge
in

he
blamed

his
opponent

accused
minton
of
playing

by
trying

give

.
he
also
criticized
minton
's
support

called

minton

minton
took
his
senate

he
sat
in
the
back
row
of
the
chamber
next
to
fellow
freshman
harry
truman
,
and
the

quickly
became
friends.
minton
was
made
a
member
of
a
special
lobby
investigation
committee
chaired
by
senator
hugo
black
,
that
was
set
up
to
look
into
questionable
lobbyist
groups.
according
to
professor
of
political
science
linda
c.
gugin
,
a
minton
biographer
,
in
practice
the
committee
's
investigations
were
politically
motivated
and
directed
against
groups
that
were
challenging
new
deal
legislation.william
randolph
hearst
,
a
prominent
and
wealthy
media
magnate
,
began
using
his
newspapers
to
deride
the
committee
's
``
reckless
attacks
on
freedom
''
.
minton
led
the
effort
to
counter
hearst
and
delivered
a
speech
criticizing
his
support
of
the
republican
party.
in
<year>
,
senator
black
was
appointed
to
the
supreme
court
and
left
the
senate
,
and
minton
secured
his
post
as
chair
of
the
committee.
minton
immediately
began
a
full-scale
investigation
of
the
media
conglomerate
controlled
by
frank
e.
gannett
,
accusing
him
of
publishing
republican
party
propaganda.
for
several
weeks
,
minton
delivered
speeches
against
gannett
in
the
senate
,
and
gannett
responded
in
kind
in
his
newspapers.
minton
finally
introduced
legislation
that
would
have
made
it
``
illegal
to
publish
information
known
to
be
false
''
.
gannett
,
and
a
large
number
of
allies
in
newspapers
and
on
radio
,
immediately
began
to
charge
minton
and
the
democratic
party
with
an
assault
on
the
freedom
of
the
press.
minton
's
allies
in
congress
asked
him
to
withdraw
the
bill
because
of
its
political
repercussions
,
and
he
dropped
the
matter.minton
tried
again
to
expose
what
he
believed
to
be
republican
control
of
the
media.
he
led
the
committee
to
target
a
newspaper
with
national
circulation
,
rural
progress.
minton
accused
the
publishers
of
improperly
accepting
large
sums
of
money
from
corporations
and
the
editors
of
undue
influence
from
this
money.
the
owner
of
the
paper
,
maurive
v.
renolds
,
was
summoned
before
the
committee
for
a
hearing
,
where
minton
demanded
to
know
why
he
was
accepting
money
from
corporations.
when
renolds
asked
his
manager
,
dr.
glen
frank
,
to
help
him
answer
the
questions
,
minton
and
fellow
democratic
senators
began
to
shout
dr.
frank
down.
as
he
was
saying
that
the
money
from
the
corporations
was
for
advertising
in
the
magazine
,
minton
beat
his
gavel
and
yelled
,
``
this
committee
does
n't
intend
to
permit
you
to
use
this
as
a
forum
to
air
your
republican
views.
''
minton
did
not
realize
that
frank
was
also
president
of
the
university
of
wisconsin
,
and
soon
suffered
retaliation
for
the
way
he
had
treated
frank.
frank
went
on
nbc
radio
stations
around
the
country
and
lambasted
minton
for
his
rudeness.
he
made
lengthy
arguments
accusing
minton
of
attempting
to
violate
the
bill
of
rights.
minton
was
outraged
,
but
the
arguments
had
an
effect
among
voters
in
indiana.
in
<year>
,
he
sought
funding
to
launch
a
massive
nationwide
investigation
of
media
conglomerates
for
proof
of
republican
interference
in
the
press.
democratic
senator
edward
r.
burke
led
an
effort
to
defeat
the
measure
and
privately
accused
minton
of
damaging
the
democrats
'
cause
,
which
led
minton
to
leave
the
lobby
investigation
committee.minton
was
a
fierce
partisan
during
his
time
in
the
senate
,
and
regularly
abused
his
opponents
verbally.
democratic
senator
huey
long
became
one
of
minton
's
favorite
targets
because
of
long
's
often-threatened
filibusters.
during
one
of
the
filibusters
,
long
threatened
to
join
the
republican
party.
after
most
senators
had
left
the
chamber
,
minton
remained
for
several
hours
to
periodically
taunt
long.
after
tiring
of
the
taunts
,
long
launched
a
rebuttal
from
the
podium
,
calling
minton
a
vicious
politician
whose
positions
would
cost
minton
re-election.
the
exchange
was
unusual
for
its
tone
and
later
made
national
news.minton
was
involved
in
many
such
exchanges
,
including
a
particularly
fierce
one
with
republican
senator
lester
j.
dickinson
in
march
<year>.
dickinson
delivered
a
speech
in
the
senate
castigating
president
franklin
d.
roosevelt
for
carrying
out
what
he
termed
illegal
and
unconstitutional
acts.
minton
responded
with
a
range
of
accusations
,
some
personal
,
against
dickinson
and
his
``
political
naivety
''
.
===
court
packing
===
in
<year>
,
the
united
states
supreme
court
ruled
the
agricultural
adjustment
act
of
<year>
unconstitutional.
for
the
first
time
,
minton
gave
speeches
criticizing
the
court
for
overriding
the
will
of
congress.
he
accused
the
court
of
allowing
itself
to
be
influenced
by
political
motives
rather
than
the
law.
in
response
to
the
court
ruling
,
minton
began
drafting
a
bill
which
would
allow
the
supreme
court
to
declare
a
law
unconstitutional
only
if
seven
out
the
nine
justices
supported
the
decision.
in
february
<year>
,
before
minton
introduced
his
bill
,
president
roosevelt
introduced
a
plan
of
his
own
to
deal
with
the
supreme
court.
roosevelt
proposed
adding
more
justices
to
the
court
and
creating
a
mandatory
retirement
age
;
the
changes
would
allow
him
to
appoint
an
overwhelming
majority
to
the
court
,
more
sympathetic
to
his
agenda
,
ensuring
the
safety
of
legislation
passed
by
his
party.minton
was
pleased
with
roosevelt
's
bill
and
quickly
became
its
leading
supporter
in
the
senate.
the
measure
was
placed
in
an
omnibus
bill
designed
to
reform
judicial
salaries
and
districting
,
among
many
other
measures.
republicans
quickly
discovered
the
court-packing
provision
and
targeted
the
bill.
democrats
had
overwhelming
super-majorities
in
congress
,
and
passage
of
the
bill
at
first
seemed
assured.
minton
's
support
of
the
bill
helped
him
earn
the
position
of
senate
majority
whip
,
allowing
him
to
more
effectively
push
for
its
passage.
minton
delivered
six
radio
addresses
on
behalf
of
his
party
in
support
of
the
bill
,
but
public
opinion
could
not
be
swayed
in
the
democrats
'
favor.minton
received
a
death
threat
in
the
form
of
an
envelope
containing
a
shotgun
shell
and
a
message
advising
him
to
not
vote
for
the
court
packing
plan.
many
democrats
,
fearing
their
re-election
prospects
,
joined
with
republicans
and
defeated
the
bill.
minton
was
unhappy
with
the
loss
and
it
cost
him
considerable
support
among
his
voters
,
but
as
a
result
of
his
close
connection
with
the
bill
and
the
leaders
of
his
party
,
he
gained
more
influence
with
the
democrats.although
minton
supported
the
roosevelt
administration
and
became
a
regular
guest
at
the
white
house
,
minton
opposed
the
president
on
some
measures.
he
voted
to
override
a
presidential
veto
of
a
grant
of
$
<decimal>
billion
(
$
<integer>
billion
in
<year>
dollars
)
in
bonus
pay
for
world
war
i
soldiers
(
bonus

)
.
he
supported
the
dyer
anti-lynching
bill
,
which
roosevelt
feared
would
cost
the
party
support
in
the
southern
states.
he
also
supported
an
extension
of
the
hatch
act
of
<year>
,
a
law
that
prevented
federal
employees
from
being
forced
to
take
part
in
state
election
campaigns
,
effectively
lessening
the
influence
of
federal
patronage.as
world
war
ii
neared
,
minton
took
a
cautious
position
on
united
states
involvement.
when
the
soviet
union
invaded
finland
,
minton
voted
against
granting
a
loan
to
finland
to
help
finance
its
defense
efforts.
he
also
opposed
selling
munitions
and
weapons
to
the
allies
or
the
axis
powers.
he
advocated
and
supported
expanding
the
american
military
and
believed
that
american
entry
into
the
war
was
inevitable
,
but
should
be
delayed
as
long
as
possible.
he
voted
in
favor
of
the
smith
act
,
which
made
it
a
crime
to
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
,
a
law
specifically
targeted
at
communists
and
fascists
in
the
united
states.
in
his
final
year
in
office
,
there
was
considerable
speculation
in
the
press
that
minton
would
be
named
to
higher
office
by
roosevelt
,
including
cabinet
positions
and
the
supreme
court
,
but
neither
happened.

,
forcing
minton
to
choose
between
the
administration
and
his
allies
in
the
state
party.
minton
sided
with
roosevelt
,
which
cost
him
mcnutt

and
the
indiana
democratic
party
machine
's
support
in
his
re-election
bid.the
republican
presidential
candidate
,
wendell
willkie
was
also
a
native
of

,
and
minton
faced
a
difficult
challenge
to
win
re-election.
he
referred
to
willkie
as
a
``
sycophant
for

rich
and
famous

.
willkie
never
responded
to
minton

leaving
minton

to
do
so
in

willis
had
run
for
the
senate
two
years
earlier
but
was
defeated
by
democrat
frederick
van

willis
faulted
minton
on
a
range
of
topics
but
focused
on
the
legislation
minton
supported
while
in
the
senate.
willis
claimed
that
much
of
the
legislation
was
unconstitutional
and
minton
's
positions
were
detrimental
to
the
nation.
minton
responded
by
pointing
out
willis
's
connections
to
wealthy
corporations
and
accused
him
of
not
caring
for
the
people.
minton
's
campaign
focused
on
the
achievements
of
the
new
deal
programs.
he
claimed
farm
income
in
indiana
had
doubled
since

,
and
highlighted
the
passage
of
the
old
age
pension
laws.
his
support
for
conscription
and
military
preparedness
for
the
coming
war
proved
unpopular
with
voters
and
cost
him
considerable
support
,
but
according
to
historian
william
radcliff
it
was
willkie
's
favorite
son
status
,
which
led
many
hoosiers
to
vote
republican

that
proved
to
be

shortly

joined

creating
a

provided
little

including

affirmed

minton
stated
on

his

jurisprudence
===
minton
was
described
by
william
radcliff
as
a
``
faithful
disciple
of
judicial
restraint
,
''
an
unexpected
development
when
compared
to
his
overtly
partisan
political
career.
radcliff
attributed
minton
's
conservative
position
to
the
distaste
he
developed
for
the
courts
when
they
overturned
legislation
passed
while
he
was
in
the
senate.
the
courts
'
actions
led
him
to
strongly
believe
in
the
limited
exercise
of
judicial
power
when
evaluating
the
constitutionality
of
governmental
conduct.
much
of
the
recently
passed
new
deal
legislation
was
being
tried
in
the
courts
for
constitutionality
and
enforcement
,
putting
minton
in
the
uncommon
position
of
adjudicating
cases
which
depended
on
legislation
he
had
helped
write.during
his
time
on
the
seventh

,
minton
authored
<integer>
of
the
court
's
opinions
,
including
twelve
dissenting
opinions.
some
of
his
opinions
won
praise
;
the
editors

commented
favorably
on
minton
's
opinions
on
tax
law
,
calling
them
``
direct
hoosier
logic
''
.
other
court
reporting
papers
made
similar
comments
,
applauding
the
manner
in
which
he
turned
complex
issues
to
simple
questions
that
could
easily
be
understood.in
the
cases
of
sunkist
v.
sunkist
and
quaker
oats
co.
v.
general
mills
,
the
court
held
that
it
was
possible
for
different
companies
to
use
the
same
brand
and
product
name
as
long
as
they
produced
dissimilar
products.
in
another
case
,
the
court
set
a
short-lived
precedent
allowing
companies
to
artificially
raise
prices
in
local
markets
if
the
purpose
was
to
artificially
lower
prices
in
another
market
to
remain
competitive.
after
minton
joined
the
united
states
supreme
court
,
the
decision
was
appealed
to
that
body
;
minton
recused
himself
from
the
case
,
which
the
court
decided
to
overturn.
in
another
decision
,
minton
was
in
the
majority
that
ruled
under
the
sherman
antitrust
act
that
the
new
york
great
atlantic
and
pacific
tea
company
was
a
monopoly
,
ordering
the
company
to
break
up
its
grocery
business.
minton
was
also
in
the

in
several
cases
filed
to
enforce
decisions
made
by
the
national
labor
relations

,
usually
to

the

denied
the
wife
of

citizen
entry
into

because
of
her
possible
ties
to

in
a
much-criticized
majority
opinion
which
minton
co-authored
with
judge
major
,
he
stated
that
the
``
alien
did
not
have
any

[
her

status
was
a
political
decision
to
be
made
by

''
many
liberals
condemned
the
court
at
the
time
of
the
decision.
the
ruling
was
upheld
by
the
supreme
court
in
a
<year>
appeal.one
of
minton
's
favorite
cases
was
that
of
modernistic
candies
,
inc.
v.
federal
trade
commission.
the
candy
company
produced
a
one-cent
gumball
dispenser
in
which
almost
all
the
gumballs
were
the
same
color.
a
few
different-colored
gumballs
were
included
which
,
when
dispensed
,
entitled
the
purchaser
to
a
prize
from
the
merchant
who
owned
the
machine.
the
ftc
had
an
injunction
put
in
place
barring
the
company
from
producing
the
machines
because
they
claimed
it
violated
anti-gambling
laws.
minton
wrote
the
majority
opinion
and
sided
with
the
majority
to
keep
the
injunction
in
place
,
but
dryly
mocked
the
counsel
for
the
defense
and
the
gambling
law
,
stating
:
counsel
for
the
petitioner
discussed
at
great
length
from
a
sociological
point
of
view
,
of
the
age-old
problem
of
the
gambling
instinct
in
the
human
being.
according
to
his
analysis
,
gambling
pervades
our
entire
economic
system
;
thus
insurance
contracts
are
a
gamble
,
stock
and
grain
exchange
transactions
are
gambles
,
and
the
farmer
's
dependence
on
weather
is
a
gamble.
counsel
's
attempt
to
apply
this
analysis
to
the
present
case
left
us
cold
and
unimpressed.
he
even
reminded
us
that
our
great
idol
,
mr.
chief
justice
john
marshall
,
in
his
day
attended
the
horse
races
and
wagered
with
his
clergyman.
in

,
they
ran
a
book.
as
indicating
how
times
have
changed
and
how
even
our
coarse
nature
has
yielded
to
the
protecting
care
of

policy
,
we
confess
we
do
not
even
know
a
bookmaker
,
clerical
or
otherwise
,
and
our
passes
to
the
beautiful
race
tracks
around
chicago
lie
in
our
desk
unused.
minton
often
lamented
that
he
was
required
to
``
pronounce
the
law

it
was
written

''
the

raised
questions
about
minton

be
confirmed
by

due
to
the

many
of

refused

hinted
in

that
it
could
be

===
judicial
restraint
===
minton
's
central
judicial
philosophy
was
to
ascertain
and
uphold
the
original
intent
of
legislation.
he
continued
to
take
a
broad
view
of
governmental
powers
,
demonstrated
in
his
dissenting
vote
in
the
case
of
youngstown
sheet
&
tube
co.
v.
sawyer
,
which
ruled
unconstitutional
president
truman
's
wartime
seizure
of
several
steel
mills
to
avert
a
workers
'
strike.
of
all
the
cases
in
which
minton
was
involved
,
he
disagreed
most
with
the
youngstown
decision
and
``
went
into
a
tirade
''
during
the
conference
where
the
decision
was
made.
he
argued
that
there
``
could
be
no
vacant
spot
in
power
when
the
security
of
the
nation
is
at
stake.
''
despite
his
strong
protest
,
he
could
not
influence
the
court
to
permit
the
president
to
seize
the
plants
without
congressional
approval.
minton
joined
with
chief
justice
fred
m.
vinson
and
justice
stanley
forman
reed
in
the
dissenting
opinion
that
the
president
had
the
authority
through
the
war
powers
clause
of
the
constitution.
minton
abhorred
racial
segregation
and
provided
a
solid
vote
to
strike
down
the
school
segregation
practices
at
issue
in
<year>
's
landmark
case
of
brown
v.
board
of
education
;
it
was
among
the
few
decisions
in
which
he
sided
against
the
government.
according
to
william
radcliff
,
the
majority
opinion
authored
by
minton
in
the
<year>
case
barrows
v.
jackson
was
his
most
skillfully
written
opinion.
he
framed
the
complex
question
of
the
case
as
:
``
can
a
racially
restrictive
covenant
be
enforced
at
law
by
a
suit
for
damages
against
a
co-covenantor
who
allegedly
broke
the
covenant
?
''
the
court
decided
the
answer
in
the
negative.in
the
area
of
civil
liberties
,
minton
adhered
to
the
doctrine
of
``
fundamental
fairness
''
,
a
test
established
by
the
supreme
court
in
<year>.
in
one
decision
,
minton
stated
that
the
right
of
free
speech
was
not
an
absolute
right
,
and
could
be
regulated
so
as
not
to
violate
the
rights
of
others.
in
united
states
v.
rabinowitz
,
minton
wrote
the
court
's
opinion
upholding
a
lower
court
ruling
which
allowed
police
to
search
automobiles
without
a
warrant
,
provided
there
was
probable
cause
to
justify
the
search.minton
voted
to
uphold
anticommunist
legislation
during
the
period
of
the
``

scare
''
,
siding
with
the
majority
in
<year>
's
dennis
v.
united
states
,
which
upheld
the
conviction
of
the
leader
of
the
us
communist
party.
during
the
same
period
,
the
court
was
split
over
the
legality
of
governmental
loyalty
tests.
many
agencies
had
programs
in
place
to
ensure
that
members
of
the
government
were
not
communists.
minton
's
vote
proved
to
be
the
deciding
factor
in
cases
regarding
loyalty
tests.
in
the
case
of
bailey
v.
richardson
,
minton
's
vote
upheld
the
legality
of
the
loyalty
tests
,
while
in
the
decision
he
authored
in
the
case
of
joint
anti-fascist
refugee
committee
v.
mcgrath
,
he
voted
to
uphold
the
plaintiff
's
position
that
he
had
been
terminated
illegally
because
of
his
support
of
fascist
ideology.
minton
's
position
gradually
shifted
to
allowing
the
loyalty
tests
to
take
place
,
and
in
adler
v.
board
of
ed.
of
city
of
new
york
he
wrote
the
majority
opinion
allowing
the
tests
and
upholding
new
york
's
feinberg
law.
this
proved
to
be
the
most
important
vote
as
it
allowed
the
tests
to
be
given
with
only
minimal
suspicion
of
a
person
's
disloyalty
to
the
government.because
of
minton
's
previous
congressional
partisanship
,
many
liberals
believed
he
would
support
their
positions
when
on
the
court.
throughout
his
tenure
,
minton
regularly
disappointed
them
,
leading
many
to
rail
against
him.
a
lawyer
writing
for
the
new
jersey
law
journal
labeled
minton
a
``
spokesman
against
freedom
''
,
calling
him
``
a
man
of
conspicuous
judicial
shortcomings
,
whose
votes
against
civil
liberties
exceeded
those
of
any
other
man
on
the
court
,
and
who
wrote
comparatively
few
opinions
of
other
kinds.
''
linda
gugin
pointed
out
that
minton
was
a
disappointment
to
liberals
because
he
consistently
chose
order
over
freedom.
gugin
also
concludes
that
minton
had
the
strongest
commitment
to
judicial
restraint
and
ideological

he
wrote

several
letters
criticizing

referring
to

he

in
a

letter
,
after
truman
left
office
,
he
urged
truman
to
help
focus
public
attention
on
the
economy
and
away
from

,
a
threat
he
claimed
the
republicans
were
exaggerating
to
avoid
confronting
their

problems.after
truman
's
withdrawal
from
the
<year>
presidential
campaign
,
minton
made
remarks
indicating
he
had
advised
truman
to
stay
out
of
the
contested
new
hampshire
primary
election
to
begin
with.
in
august

a

asked

about

minton
answered
,
``

''
he
also
remarked
that
dwight

was
politically

minton
was
lambasted
in

during

it

minton
transformed
from
a

into
an
almost
reactionary
judge
as
an
ally
of
justice
felix
frankfurter.
empirical
coding
of
votes
shows
that
minton
was
the
most
conservative
justice
on
the
court
during
his
first

,
and
remained
in
the
conservative
half
of

after
the
deaths
of
chief

justice
robert

minton
found
himself
with
little

of

led
him
to
begin
considering
retirement.the
shifting

dryly
stated

eisenhower
responded

brief
note
wishing

although
he

minton
informed

despite
the
health

minton
regretted
his
decision
almost
immediately.minton
returned
to
his
new
albany
home
,
where
he
took

he
gave

death
and
legacy

in
late
march
<year>
,
minton
was
admitted
to
floyd
memorial
hospital
in
new
albany
,
where
it
was
found
he
was
suffering
internal
bleeding.
he
died
in
his
sleep
early
in
the
morning
of
april
<integer>.
minton
's
wife
was
roman
catholic
;
his
funeral
was
held
at
the
now-defunct
holy
trinity
catholic
church
and
was
attended
by
many
dignitaries
,
including
several
sitting
members
of
the
supreme
court
,
the
governors
of
indiana
and
kentucky
,
and
several
members
of
congress.
he
was
buried
in
the
holy
trinity
cemetery
,
on
green
valley
road
in
new
albany
,
next
to
leo
receveur.
minton
himself
was
nominally
catholic
and
had
shunned
christianity
for
most
of
his
life
;
he
only
began
to
occasionally
attend
mass
following
his
retirement.
he
left
most
of
his
personal
papers
and
judicial
records
to
the
truman
presidential
library.minton
is
the
eponym
of
the
sherman

which
carries
interstate
<integer>
across
the
ohio
river
,
connecting
western
louisville
,
kentucky
with
new
albany
,
indiana.
minton
attended
the
dedication
of
the
bridge
at
a
<year>
ceremony.
he
is
also
the
namesake
of
the
annual
sherman
minton
moot
court
competition
,
held
at
the
indiana
university
maurer
school
of
law.
he
is
also
honored
(
with
indiana
senator
homer
e.
capehart
)
—in
the
``
brutalist
''
style
designed
by

by
milton
glaser—in
the
centrally
located
minton-capehart
federal
building
on

war
memorial
plaza
in
indianapolis.
a
bronze
bust
of
minton
was
created
and
put
on
display
in
the
indiana
statehouse.while
some
writers
like
linda
gugin
and
legal
historian
william
radcliff
have
given
high
praise
to
minton
's
logic
in
his
written
opinions
,
they
point
out
that
his
positions
had
little
long-term
impact.
other
legal
historians
,
like
bernard
schwartz
,
have
a
more
negative
opinion
of
minton
's
judicial
career.
schwartz
wrote
that
minton
``
was
below
mediocrity
as
a
justice.
his
opinions
,
relatively
few
for
his
tenure
,
are
less
than
third
rate
,
characterized
by
their
cavalier
approach
to
complicated
issues.
''
schwartz
went
on
to
say
,
``
he
ranks
near
the
bottom
of
any
list
of
justices.
''
most
of
the
precedents
minton
helped
establish
were
overturned
by
the
warren
court
in
the
years
immediately
following
his
retirement.
in
total
he
wrote
sixty-seven
majority
opinions
along
with
several
of
the
dissenting
opinions.
gugin
authored
a
work
in
rebuttal
to
schwartz
's
harsh
critique
,
saying
that
minton
's
rulings
were
``
predictable
based
on
the
principles
of
deference
,
precedent
,
and
strict
interpretation
''
;
she
attributed
his
poor
ranking
to
the
bias
of
reviewers
in
favor
of
judicial
activism.minton
's
time
on
the
court
marked
the
end
of
a
transitory
period
in
the
judiciary.
since
minton
,
justices
have
tended
to
serve
increasingly
longer
terms
on
the
court
,
which
has
had
strong
political
science
implications
on
the
supreme
court.
the
growing
concept
of
judicial
non-partisanship
became
the
norm
in
american
politics
after
minton—he
was
the
last
member
of
congress
to
be
appointed
to
the
court.
linda
gugin
and
professor
james
st.
clair
have
noted
that
the
federal
courts
have
lost
a
valuable
point
of
view
by
not
having
experienced
legislators
among
their
ranks.minton
played
an
important
role
behind
the
scenes
of
the
court
as
a
peacemaker
between
its
two
opposing
factions.
these
attempts
to
keep
the
peace
led
justice
frankfurter
to
remark
that
while
minton
would
never
be
remembered
as
a
great
justice
,
he
would
be
remembered
as
a
great
colleague
by
his
fellow
justices.

an
american

conducted
seminal
research
in
animal
behavior
,
animal
navigation
,
acoustic
orientation
and
sensory
biophysics.
in
<year>
,
while
an
undergraduate
at

,
he
began
studying
the
navigational
method
of

,
which
he
identified
as
animal
echolocation
in
<year>.
in
the
question
of
animal
awareness
(
<year>
)
,
he
argued
that
animals
are
conscious
like
humans.
griffin
was
the

the

biography

griffin
was
born
on
august
<integer>
,
<year>
in
southampton
,
new

and
attended
harvard
university
,
where
he
was
awarded
bachelor
's
,
master
's
and
doctoral
degrees.
after
serving
on
the
faculty
of
cornell
university
he
became
a
professor
at
his
alma
mater
and
later
worked
at
rockefeller
university.while
at
harvard
in
the
late
<year>s
,
griffin
worked
with
robert
galambos
on
studies
of
animal
echolocation.
griffin
conducted
preliminary
tests
during
the
summer
of
<year>
when
he
was
a
research
fellow
at
the
edmund
niles
huyck
preserve
and
biological
research
station
in
rensselaerville
,
new
york.
he
set
up
a
minimal
bat
flight
facility
in
a
<integer>-by<integer>
square-foot
room
in
a
barn
and
then
measured
the
ability
of
bats
to
avoid
obstacles
by
having
them
fly
through
a
barrier
of
metal
wires
suspended
from
a
ceiling.the
remaining
work
was
done
at
harvard
's
physical
laboratories.
using
sound
capture
technology
that
had
been
developed
by
physicist
g.
w.
pierce
,
galambos
and
pierce
were
able
to
determine
that
bats
generate
and
hear
sounds
an
octave
higher
than
can
be
heard
by
humans
and
other
animals.
experiments
they
conducted
used
methods
developed
by
hallowell
davis
to
monitor
the
brains
of
bats
and
their
hearing
responses
as
they
navigated
their
way
past
wires
suspended
from
a
laboratory
ceiling.
they
showed
how
bats
used
echolocation
to
accurately
avoid
obstacles
,
which
they
were
unable
to
do
if
their
mouths
or
ears
were
kept
shut.
griffin
coined
the
term
``
echolocation
''
in
<year>
to
describe
the
phenomenon
,
which
many
physiologists
of
the
day
could
not
believe
was
possible.
during
world
war
ii
,
griffin
worked
for
national
defense
research
committee
where
he
supported
the
approval
of
the
bat
bomb.at
a
time
when
animal
thinking
was
a
topic
deemed
unfit
for
serious
research
,
griffin
became
a
pioneer
in
the
field
of
cognitive
ethology
,
starting
research
in
<year>
that
studied
how
animals
think.
his
observations
of
the
sophisticated
abilities
of
animals
to
gather
food
and
interact
with
their
environment
and
each
other
led
him
to
conclude
that
animals
were
conscious
,
thinking
beings
,
not
the
mere
automatons
that
had
been
postulated.
in
its
obituary
,
the
new
york
times
credited
griffin
as
``
the
only
reason
that
animal
thinking
was
given
consideration
at
all
''
.
while
critics
argue
that
cognitive
ethology
is
anthropomorphic
and
subjective
,
those
in
the
field
have
studied
the
ways
that
animals
form
concepts
and
mental
states
based
on
their
interactions
with
their
environment
,
showing
how
animals
base
their
actions
and
anticipate
the
responses
of
other
sentient
beings.

career

==
contributions
to
economic
theory
==
modigliani
,
beginning
in
the
<year>s
,
was
an
originator
of
the
life-cycle
hypothesis
,
which
attempts
to
explain
the
level
of
saving
in
the
economy.
the
hypothesis
that
consumers
aim
for
a
stable
level
of
consumption
throughout
their
lifetime
(
for
example
by
saving
during
their
working
years
and
then
spending
during
their
retirement
)
.
the
rational
expectations
hypothesis
is
considered
by
economists
to
originate
in
the
paper
written
by
modigliani
and
emile
grunberg
in
<year>.when
he
was
a
member
of
the
carnegie
mellon
university
faculty
,
he
formulated
in
<year>
,
along
with
merton
miller
,
the
modigliani–miller
theorem
for
corporate
finance.
the
theorem
posits
that
,
under
certain
assumptions
,
the
value
of
a
firm
is
not
affected
by
whether
it
is
financed
by
equity
(
selling
shares
)
or
by
debt
(
borrowing
money
)
,
meaning
that
the
debt-to-equity
ratio
is
unimportant
for
private
firms.in
the
early
<year>s
,
his
response
,
co-authored
with
albert
ando
,
to
the
<year>
paper
of
milton
friedman
and
david
i.
meiselman
,
initiated
the
so-called
``
monetary/fiscal
policy
debate
''
among
economists
,
which
went
on
for
more
than
sixty
years.in
<year>
,
modigliani
,
in
a
paper
whose
co-author
was
his
former
student
lucas
papademos
,
introduced
the
concept
of
the
``
niru
''
,
the
non-inflationary
rate
of
unemployment
,
ostensibly
an
improvement
over
the
``
natural
rate
of
unemployment
''
concept.
the
terms
refer
to
a
level
of
unemployment
below
which
inflation
rises.in
<year>
,
modigliani
and
his
granddaughter
,
leah
modigliani
,
developed
what
is
now
called
the
``
modigliani
risk-adjusted
performance
,
''
a
measure
of
the
risk-adjusted
returns
of
an
investment
portfolio
that
was
derived
from
the
sharpe
ratio
,
adjusted
for
the
risk
of
the
portfolio
relative
to
that
of
a
benchmark
,
e.g.
the
``
market.
''
==
appointments
and
awards
==
in
october
<year>
,
modigliani
was
awarded
the
nobel
prize
in
economics
``
for
his
pioneering
analyses
of
saving
and
of
financial
markets.
''
in
<year>
,
modigliani
received
mit
's
james
r.
killian
faculty
achievement
award.
in
<year>
,
he
received
an
honoris
causa
degree
in
management
engineering
from
the
university
of
naples
federico
ii
in
<year>.
late
in
his
life
,
modigliani
became
a
trustee
of
the
economists
for
peace
and
security
organization
,
formerly
``
economists
allied
for
arms
reduction
''
and
was
considered
an
``
influential
adviser
''
:
in
the
late
<year>s
,
on
a
contract
with
the
federal
reserve
,
he
designed
the
``
mit-pennsylvania-social
science
research
council
''
model
,
a
tool
that
``
guided
monetary
policy
in
washington
for
many
decades.

a

papers

==
criticism
==
modigliani
's
work
on
fiscal
policy
came
under
criticism
from
followers
of
post-keynesian
economics
,
who
disputed
the
``
keynesianism
''
of
his
viewpoints
,
pointing
out
his
contribution
to
the
nairu
concept
,
as
well
as
his
general
stance
on
fiscal
deficits.
the
modigliani-miller
theorem
implies
that
,
for
a
closed
economy
,
state
borrowing
is
merely
deferred
taxation
,
since
state
spending
can
be
financed
only
by
``
printing
money
''
,
taxation
,
or
borrowing
,
and
therefore
monetary
financing
of
state
spending
implies
the
subsequent
imposition
of
a
so-called
``
inflation
tax
,
''
which
ostensibly
has
the
same
effect
on
permanent
income
as
explicit
taxation.nonetheless
,
they
acknowledged
his
dissenting
voice
on
the
issue
of
unemployment
,
in
which
modigliani
concurred
early
on
with
heterodox
economists
that
europe-wide
unemployment
in
the
late
<integer>th
century
was
caused
by
the
lack
of
demand
induced
by
austerity
policies.

university
,
where
his
work
with
the
rockefeller

and
with
foreign

dramatically
upgraded
the

he
also
instituted
a
long-term
research
project
on
raising
the
productivity
and

villagers.
it
was
during
this
period
that
he
was
invited
to
serve
as
a
visiting
professor
at
both
cambridge

universities
and
was
appointed
to
the

(

,
the

puey
played
an
instrumental
role
in
the
establishment
of
the
bangkok-based
asian

of
technology
(

)
,
previously
the
graduate
school
of
engineering
of
the
southeast

(

in

dr
puey
became
the
first
chairperson
of

from
<year>

<year>.
after
the
ousting
of
thanom
's

in
october
<year>
,
puey
was
catapulted
into
political
prominence
and
,
along
with
m.r.
kukrit

was
broadly
promoted

self-examination
,
puey
disavowed
all
interest
in
such
a
candidacy
and
returned
to
thammasat
,
where
he
was
appointed
rector.
puey
's
explanation
was
that
when
he
had
joined
the
free
thai
movement
he
had
taken
an
oath
never
to
seek
or
accept
political
appointment
until
after
reaching
the
age
of
retirement.
some
have
argued
,
however
,
that
puey
's
withdrawal
was
based
upon
his
mature
understanding
of
the
nature
of
society
and
that
he
had
accurately
foreseen
that
the
upcoming
democratic
period
would
be
inherently
unstable
,
dangerous
,
and
short-lived.
==
exile

despite
his
service
,
honesty
and
international
reputation
,
puey
was
branded
a
communist
and
``
destroyer
of
unity
''
by
the
political
right
of
thailand.
although
he
spoke
out
against
the
unending
student
demonstrations
of
<year>–<integer>
as
being
both
ineffective
and
self-destructive
,
and
even
denied
his
students
any
use
of
the
thammasat
campus
as
a
base
for
mounting
public
demonstrations
,
he
was
nevertheless
assigned
blame

on

puey
resigned

following

,
puey
suffered
a
haemorrhagic

==
legacy
==
puey
's
status
as
a
hero
derives
from
several
obvious
,
but
special
,
features
of
his
career
and
character.
his
most
significant
,
if
paradoxical
,
attribute
was
his
willingness
to
work
for
the
thai
bureaucratic
establishment
and
yet
maintain
his
moral
independence
,
intellectual
creativity
,
and
sense
of
social
responsibility.
his
capacity
to
strike
a
compromise
between
what
was
objectively
possible
and
morally
desirable
was
an
extraordinary
accomplishment.
it
had
a
particular
impact
on
younger
people
,
almost
all
of
whose
models
have
traditionally
been
either
successful
rogues
who
manipulate
their
social
environment
for
their
own
advantage
or
martyrs
who
succumb
to
it.
even
more
commendable
was
his
deep
sense
of
incorruptibility.
over
the
years
,
he
held
a
variety
of
jobs
and
served
on
a
number
of
commissions
that
,
in
terms
of
standard
thai
corrupt
practices
,
could
have
made
him
a
very
wealthy
man.
further
,
puey
's
incorruptibility
was
more
than
merely
passive.
as
an
economist
he
was
keenly
aware
that
official
corruption
was
depriving
the
thai
treasury
of
inordinately
large
sums
,
and
in
public
addresses
and
statements
he
would
often
include
selections
of
thinly
veiled
,
but
cutting
,
poetic
attacks
against
the
specific
acts
of
the
very
highest
government
officials.
puey
's
career
is
also
powerful
evidence
of
how
education—in
contrast
to
wealth
,
political
power
,
and
connections—could
be
used
to
climb
the
thai
status
ladder.
in
<year>
he
was
recognised
by
unesco
for
his
high
ethical
standards.

amos
tversky
's
most
influential
work
was
done
with
his
longtime
collaborator
,
daniel
kahneman
,
in
a
partnership
that
began
in
the
late
<year>s.
their
work
explored
the
biases
and
failures
in
rationality
continually
exhibited
in
human
decision-making.
starting
with
their
first
paper
together
,
``
belief
in
the
law
of
small
numbers
''
,
kahneman
and
tversky
laid
out
eleven
``
cognitive
illusions
''
that
affect
human
judgment
,
frequently
using
small-scale
empirical
experiments
that
demonstrate
how
subjects
make
irrational
decisions
under
uncertain
conditions.
(
they
introduced
the
notion
of
cognitive
bias
in

)
this
work
was
highly
influential
in
the
field

,
which
had
largely
presumed

in

tried

factors
included
tversky
receiving
most
of
the
external
credit
for
the
output
of
the
partnership
,
and
a
reduction
in
the
generosity
with
which
tversky
and
kahneman
interacted
with
each
other.
====
comparative
ignorance
====
tversky
and
fox
(
<year>
)
addressed
ambiguity
aversion
,
the
idea
that
people
do
not
like
ambiguous
gambles
or
choices
with
ambiguity
,
with
the
comparative
ignorance
framework.
their
idea
was
that
people
are
only
ambiguity
averse
when
their
attention
is
specifically
brought
to
the
ambiguity
by
comparing
an
ambiguous
option
to
an
unambiguous
option.
for
instance
,
people
are
willing
to
bet
more
on
choosing
a
correct
colored
ball
from
an
urn
containing
equal
proportions
of
black
and
red
balls
than
an
urn
with
unknown
proportions
of
balls
when
evaluating
both
of
these
urns
at
the
same
time.
however
,
when
evaluating
them
separately
,
people
are
willing
to
bet
approximately
the
same
amount
on
either
urn.
thus
,
when
it
is
possible
to
compare
the
ambiguous
gamble
to
an
unambiguous
gamble
people
are
averse
—
but
not
when
one
is
ignorant
of
this
comparison.

riedl
(
<day>
–
<day>
)
was
an
austrian
zoologist.
==
biography
==
riedl
was
a
scientist
with
broad
interests
,
whose
influence
in
epistemology
grounded
in
evolutionary
theory
was
notable
,
although
less
in
english-speaking
circles
than
in
german
or
even
spanish
speaking
ones.
his
<year>
work
,
biology
of
knowledge
:
the
evolutionary
basis
of
reason
examined
cognitive
abilities
and
the
increasing
complexity
of
biological
diversification
over
the
immense
periods
of
evolutionary
time.riedl
built
upon
the
work
of
the
viennese
school
of
thought
initially
typified
by
konrad
lorenz
,
and
continued
in
vienna
by
gerhard
vollmer
,
franz
wuketits
,
and
in
spain
by
nicanor
ursura.
riedl
was
skeptical
of
german
idealism
,
and
nourished
by
the
tradition
that
produced
the
scientists
and
philosophers
of
science
ernst
mach
,
ludwig
boltzmann
,
erwin
schrödinger
,
karl
popper
,
hans
reichenbach
and
sigmund
freud.
lorenz
believed
that
the
kantian
framework
of
cognitive
concepts
such
as
three-dimensional
space
and
time
were
not
fixed
but
built
up
over
phylogenetic
history
,
potentially
subject
to
further
developments.
lorenz’s
position
,
as
expanded
by
riedl
,
attempted
to
make
it
easier
to
assimilate
non-common
sense
areas
of
physics
such
as
quantum
field
theory
and
string
theory.
riedl
drew
clear
distinctions
between
the
deductive
and
inductive
(
non
conscious
)
cognitive
processes
characteristic
of
the
left
and
right
cerebral
hemispheres.
his
analysis
of
what
he
called
``
the
pitfalls
of
reason
''
deserves
special
attention.
he
,
like
lorenz
,
was
concerned
with
cognitive
processes
that
might
endanger
the
future
of
civilization.
riedl
had
less
direct
influence
on
academic
philosophy
than
his
profound
influence
on
the
thinking
of
investigators
in
neuroscience
such
as
michael
gazzaniga
,
antonio
damasio
,
and
vilayanur
s.
ramachandran
,
whose
investigations
combine
synergistically
with
those
of
more
physiologically-oriented
scientists
such
as
eric
kandel
and
rodolfo
llinás
,
as
well
as
computational
models
that
take
advantage
of
the
techniques
of
systems
dynamics
as
practiced
by
the
physiologists
denis
noble
and
p.
read
montague.
riedl
contributed
to
developmental
biology
,
morphology
,
evolution
(
a
systems
approach
)
and
evolutionary
epistemology.
he
was
the
founder
president
of
the
club
of
vienna.
==
evolutionary
views
==
riedl
held
the
opinion
that
the
modern
synthesis
of
the
mid<integer>th
century
had
ignored
the
role
of
development
and
morphology
in
evolution.
he
argued
that
the
modern
synthesis
had
failed
to
explain
the
origin
of
body
plans
and
patterns
at
the
macroevolutionary
level.
he
presented
his
evolutionary
theory
in
order
in
living
organisms
:
a
systems
analysis
of
evolution
(
translated
,
<year>
)
.
he
called
for
an
extended
evolutionary
synthesis
to
integrate
processes
from
developmental
biology
and
macroevolutionary
perspectives.
riedl
and
michael
conrad
in
the
<year>s
were
the
first
two
scientists
to
propose
explicit
mechanisms
for
the
evolution
of

his

led
to
a

his
employment
at

tony
fu-lai
yu
speculates
that
the
time
li
spent
in
mainland
china
,
as
well
as
his
science-based
university
education
,
greatly
influenced
his
policy-making
in
taiwan.
li
had
no
formal
training
in
economics
,
thus
most
of
his
knowledge
of
economic
management
was
gained
from
practical
experience
and
working
with
other
economists.
consequently
,
yu
argues
his
policy
was
insulated
from
popular
economic
ideology
and
instead
was
driven
by
pragmatism.
li
himself
also
claims
that
the
purpose
of
his
writings
is
to
reveal
his
policy-making
experiences
for
the
future
reference
of
other
developing

,
and
did
not
engage
in
writing
about

,

,
or

science
theory.yu
argues
that
li
's
policy-making
can
be
explained
by
evolutionary
economics.
two
yale
economists
,
gustav
ranis
and
john
c.h.
fei
,
wrote
the
introductory
essays
to
li
's
<year>
book
the
evolution
of
policy
behind
taiwan
's
development
success.
therefore
,
it
can
be
interpreted
that
ranis
and
fei
's
views
on
economic
policy
are
representative
of
li's.ranis
mainly
writes
on
neo-classical
growth
theory
,
which
claims
that
a
steady
economic
growth
rate
can
be
achieved
by
correctly
balancing
the
driving
forces
of
labor
,
capital
,
and

he
also
writes
on
the
concept

surplus
economies
which
,
in
freeing
up
workers
and
generating
agricultural
surplus
and
leading
to
increased
productivity
in
expanding
commercial
sectors.fei
argues
that
two
main
types
of
forces
govern
policy
evolution
:
objective
and
subjective.
objective
forces
are
predetermined
conditions
,
encompassing
physical
environments
,
external
economic
conditions

etc.
subjective
forces
include
personal
beliefs
,
economic
knowledge
,

experiences
,
and
``
common
sense.
''
fei
believes
that
political
beliefs
and
ideology
are
the
strongest
factors
in
shaping
economic
policy-making
,
and
thus
is
an
ongoing
process.
in
following
with
the
concept
of
evolutionary
economics
,
fei
believes
that
economic
policy
must
change
to
suit
new
and
ever-changing
situations.
therefore
,
policy
should
not
be
static
when
created
and
instead
evolve
and
be
improved
on
to
adapt
to
new
situations.
li
himself
claims
that
the
liberalization
of
the
taiwanese
economy
was
a
gradual
process
rather
than
an
abrupt
one
following
the
international
fad
of
free
market
ideology
in
the
<year>s
and
<year>s.
===
pragmatic
economics
===
li
argues
that
there
are
two
types
of
issues
central
to
analyzing
policy
evolution.
first
is
the
economic
impact
of
a
policy
,
second
is
causation
,
or
why
a
certain
policy
appears
and
is
implemented
at
a
certain
time.
li
believes
pragmatism
should
supersede
ideology
in
terms
of
policy-making
:
[
policy
innovation
should
be
based
on
]
the
anticipation
of
impending
problems
and
conflicts
,
rather
than
be
purely
ideologically
motivated
.
.
.
the
very
notion
of
an
evolution
of
policy
suggests
that
the
timing
(
or
timely
appearance
)
of
a
particular
policy
is
important
,
and
a
good
policy
innovation
is
one
that
does
not
arrive
prematurely.
ideological
considerations
often
get
in
the
way
of
appropriate
timing
as
,
for
example
,
with
so-called
welfare
state
legislation
that
the
economy
simply
can
not
support.
what
can
almost
be
called
a
rejection
of
ideology
lies
at
the
heart
of
a
healthy
pragmatism
that
has
guided
policymakers
in
taiwan
and
has
supported
a
social
consensus
for
growth
and
economic
liberalization.he
argues
against
ideology-based
policy
making
because
it
often
interferes
with
the
timing
of
certain
policies
,
and
all
too
often
change
too
quickly.
he
believes
such
policy
is
“motivated
by
goals
considered
larger
than
people’s
actual
well-being
,
”
which
is
a
scathing
review
of
ideology-based
policy.
rather
than
ideology
,
li
believes
the
economic
environment
in
which
policies
are
made
is
more
important
and
that
policy
should
not
be
restricted
by
the
ulterior
motives
of
ideology-based
economics.
===
policy
revision
===
li
's
trial
and
error
policy
making
was
made
possible
by
taiwan
's
flexible
government
policy.
li
says
that
it
made
it
possible
to
abandon
or
modify
ineffective
programs
and
easily
create
and
implement
new
ones
in
reaction
to
new
situations.li
's
policies
were
often
influenced
by
his
experiences
as
part
of
the
kuomintang
in
mainland
china.
hyperinflation
was
one
of
the
major
reasons
that
chiang
kai-shek
lost
mainland
china
to
the
communist
party
,
and
thus
li
abhorred
all
inflationary
finance
during
his
management
of
taiwan
's
economy.
his
aversion
to
relying
on
inflation
is
apparent
in
his
claim
:
taiwan’s
experience
shows
that
fiscal
reforms
(
tax
legislation
)
and
monetary
reforms
(
moving
toward
central
bank
autonomy
)
are
major
evolu-
tionary
steps
taken
by
a
responsible
government
.
.
.
what
underlies
both
reforms
is
a
rejection
of
the
insanity
of
relying
on
the
printing
press
to
create
purchasing
power
for
the
government
to
use
in
an
effort
to
solve
socioeconomic
problems.li
indicates
that
this
was
the
main
difference
between
taiwan
's
policy
and
those
in
latin
american
countries
,
and
that
this
method
of
managing
the
economy
led
to
an
overall
more
responsible
government
and
transparent
taxation
system.
li
claims
that
during
the
<year>s–<integer>s
,
the
liberalization
of
taiwan
's
economy
was
an
unintended
effect
of
their
new
policy
,
and
it
was
n't
until
<year>
that
such
``
externally-oriented
growth
''
was
seen
as
beneficial
and
the
merging
of
international
competition
in
the
domestic
market
was
encouraged.
furthermore
,
li
says
that
taiwan
's
government
was
guided
at
the
start
with
the
principle
that
private
property
and
a
market
environment
which
favored
private
businesses
were
to
be
encouraged.
li
writes
:
other
promotional
measures
taken
by
the
government
included
improving
the
investment
climate
,
simplifying
administrative
procedures
.
.
.
providing
necessary
financing
through
banking
institutions
,
and
promoting
investment
and
exports
through
tax
relief
and
other
incentives.this
was
the
framework
for
li
's
principle
of
people
's
livelihood
where
the
importance
of
protecting
private
property
for
the
improvement
of
socioeconomic
activities
and
establishing
a
free
economy
was
only
superseded
by
the
need
to
expand
state
capital.
yu
claims
that
this
view
falls
under
what
robert
wade
calls
the
``
guided
market
economy.
''
li
argues
that
the
main
problem
with
other
less
developed
countries
(
ldcs
)
was
that
:
the
alleged
failure
of
the
market
in
some
other
ldcs
may
,
in
fact
,
be
due
precisely
to
the
opposite
reason
:
the
failure
of
political
intervention
in
the
market.
although
the
market
structure
was
far
from
perfect
at
the
beginning
of
transition
growth
in
the
<year>s
,
the
overall
trend
has
been
for
a
strengthening
of
the
market
mechanism—a
depoliticizing
of
the
market.
taiwan
experience
shows
that
reduced
intervention
can
work.li
argues
that
without
the
same
willingness
in
developing
countries
to
support
a
free
market
,
taiwan
's
economic
miracles
and
history
are
useless
to
them.
===
government
's
role
===
li
explains
that
taiwan
's
economic
development
was
initially
set
back
by
the
``
scarcity
of
natural
resources
,
shortages
of
capital
and
foreign
exchange
,
technological
backwardness
,
and
lack
of
entrepreneurial
skills
,
''
however
,
through
the
government
's
direct
involvement
and
encouragement
,
the
infrastructure
and
incentives
needed
for
private
enterprises
to
flourish
,
including
mitigation
of
risk
,
was
created
:
among
the
major
initiatives
have
been
:
the
formulation
of
investment
program
and
the
provision
of
low-interest
loans
;
the
establishment
of
industrial
zones
,
export-processing
zones
,
and
the
science-based
industrial
park
;
ten
major
development
projects
,
the
twelve
new
development
projects
and
the
fourteen
key
projects
in
the
<year>s
and
<year>s.
the
government
also
adopted
various
supplementary
fiscal
,
financial
,
foreign-exchange
,
and
trade-promotion
measures
to
quicken
the
pace
of
industrialization.taiwan
's
government
made
certain
to
not
compete
with
private
enterprises
unless
absolutely
necessary
,
and
the
most
lucrative
investment
projects
were
left
for
private
businesses
to
take.
many
times
the
government
would
first
conduct
feasibility
studies
before
offering
low
interest
loans
to
private
entrepreneurs.
other
times
the
government
acted
as
sole
owner
of
a
business
before
handing
it
over
to
private
investors.however
,
li
was
a
strong
believer
that
it
was
important
for
the
government
to
step
back
once
the
private
sector
became
more
established.
fiscal
policy
would
then
become
more
of
a
``
stabilizing
and
equilibrating
mechanism
to
counterbalance
fluctuations
in
private
economic
behaviour.
the
evolution
of
fiscal
policy
in
taiwan
has
followed
the
same
progression
.
.
.
with
government
intervention
diminishing
as
the
economy
moved
steadily
in
the
direction
of
liberalization.
''
this
leads
to
li
's
argument
that
there
are
two
main
major
roles
played
by
the
government
in
economic
development
:
enforcement
of
competition
:
to
promote
competition
in
small
developing
countries
,
it
is
best
to
open
up
the
economy
and
expose
domestic
enterprises
to
international
competition.
li
believes
anti-trust
laws
are
superfluous
in
open
economies.
in
new
industries
,
government
protection
should
only
be
given
in
the
initial
period.
identify
the
areas
of
production
characterized
by
externality
(
``
activities
where
the
producers
of
the
goods
or
services
can
not
easily
charge
those
who
benefit
''
--
this
is
somewhat
different
from
the
common
view
of
externality
)
:
goods
with
external
effect
are
not
fixed
and
will
mature
with
the
economy.
thus
,
government
operated
sectors
can
become
more
privatized
as
the
economy
matures
,
although
it
is
reasonably
difficult
to
decide
what
the
government
should
provide
based
on
external
economies
,
and
therefore
should
remain
an
ongoing
task.
===
transferability
===
on
the
topic
of
taiwan
's
economic
success
being
transferable
to
other
developing
countries
,
li
believes
that
:
...
while
our
policy
experiences
can
not
be
transferred
to
ldcs
as
a
whole
package
,
individual
measures
(
such
as
epzs
and
investment
incentives
)
that
i
introduced
have
,
from
time
to
time
,
been
adopted
successfully
by
neighbouring
countries
[
...
]
if
an
experience
can
be
transferable
at
all
,
the
key
question
concerns
the
circumstances
under
which
the
policy
is
instituted.
if
the
circumstances
are
too
different
,
it
is
not
likely
that
the
policy
will
lead
to
the
same
result.
the
question
of
a
policy’s
result
is
an
economic
issue
,
but
the
way
policy
is
formulated
is
a
political
issue.
good
economics
can
be
rejected
by
bad
politics.
hence
,
whether
or
not
taiwan’s
policy
experience
can
be
transferred
to
other
developing
economies
depends
very
much
on
whether
their
cultures
can
allow
pragmatism
to
overcome
ideology
as
well
as
on
how
strongly
they
are
dedicated
to
political
and
economic
freedom.although
taiwan
experienced
relative
economic
success
over
the
course
of
its
history
along
with
the
other
four
asian
tigers
which
employed
similar
economic
policies
as
taiwan
,
the
lack
of
the
same
``
miraculous
''
development
in
latin
american
countries
that
employed
the
same
principles
brings
into
question
whether
li
's
policies
can
be
fully
transferred
and
result
in
unequivocal
success.
li
also
did
not
consider
external
factors
that

was

homans
,
with

attended

influenced
by
professor
elton
mayo
,
where
he
was
assigned
to
readings
by
prominent
social

from

``
members

which
was
led
by

inspired
by
the
work

form
his

skinner
taught
homans
about

the
idea

``

can

undertook
an
anthropological
study

rural
england

published

this

,
he

<integer>th

he
retired
from

in

==
theoretical
agenda
and
general
argument
==
as
a
theorist
,
homans
'
overall
intellectual
ambition
was
to
create
a
more
unified
social
science
on
a
firm
theoretical
basis.
his
approach
to
theory
developed
in
two
phases
,
usually
interpreted
by
commentators
as
inductive
and
deductive.
although
this
is
a
bit
of
an
oversimplification
,
it
provides
a
framework
for
outlining
his
theoretical
contributions.
in
its
mature
(
<year>
)
form
,
homans
'
theory
rests
upon
two
metatheoretical
claims
:
(
<integer>
)
the
basic
principles
of
social
science
must
be
true
of
individuals
as
members
of
the
human
species
,
not
as
members
of
particular
groups
or
cultures
;
and
(
<integer>
)
any
other
generalizations
or
facts
about
human
social
life
will
be
derivable
from
these
principles
(
and
suitable
initial
conditions
)
.
he
argued
that
large-scale
structures
can
be
understood
if
we
understand
elementary
social
behavior.another
way
to
grasp
his
argument
is
to
interpret
it
as
striving
to
explain
spontaneous
social
order
,
a
point
developed
in
detail
by
fararo
(
<year>
)
.
homans
'
approach
is
an
example
of
methodological
individualism
in
social
science
,
also
favored
by
some
more
recent
influential
social
theorists
,
particularly
those
who
have
adopted
some
form
of
rational
choice
theory
(
e.g.
,
james
s.
coleman
)
that
enables
greater
deductive
fertility
in
theorizing—albeit
often
with
a
cost
in
terms
of
some
loss
of
realism.
==
the
human
group
==
homans
was
impressed
by
henderson
's
notion
of
a
conceptual
scheme.
a
conceptual
scheme
consists
of
a
classification
of
variables
(
or
concepts
)
that
need
to
be
taken
into
account
when
studying
a
set
of
phenomena.
it
also
consists
of
a
sketch
of
the
given
conditions
within
which
the
phenomena
are
to
be
analyzed.
it
also
must
contain
a
statement
that
the
variables
are
related
to
one
another—and
following
pareto
,
that
relationship
is
usually
seen
as
one
of
mutual
dependence.homans
was
very
interested
in
henderson
's
conceptual
scheme
as
a
way
of
classifying
phenomena
and
applied
it
to
his
own
study
of
small
groups.
henderson
's
teachings
were
included
in
homans
'
work
the
human
group
(
<year>
)
.
this
book
's
ultimate
goal
was
to
move
from
a
study
of
the
social
system
as
it
is
exemplified
in
single
groups
toward
a
study
of
the
system
as
it
is
exemplified
in
many
groups
,
including
groups
changing
in
time.
the
work
has
a
theme
of
,
``
the
way
group
norms
develop
and
the
ways
a
group
,
consciously
or
unconsciously
,
seeks
to
maintain
the
cohesion
of
the
group
when
members
depart
from
group
norms.
''
homans
establishes
that
,
``
the
general
propositions
would
have
to
meet
only
one
condition
:
in
accordance
with
my
original
insight
,
they
should
apply
to
individual
human
beings
as
members
of
a
species.
''
homans
said
,
``
if
we
wanted
to
establish
the
reality
of
a
social
system
as
a
complex
of
mutually
dependent
elements
,
why
not
begin
by
studying
a
system
small
enough
so
that
we
could
,
so
to
speak
,
see
all
the
way
around
it
,
small
enough
so
that
all
the
relevant
observations
could
be
made
in
detail
and
at
first
hand
?
''
he
fulfilled
this
study
throughout
the
human
group.
this
book
allowed
him
to
make
certain
generalizations
,
including
the
idea
that
the
more
frequently
people
interact
with
one
another
,
when
no
one
individually
initiates
interactions
more
than
others
,
the
greater
is
their
liking
for
one
another
and
their
feeling
of
ease
in
one
another
's
presence.
although
this
was
n't
homans
'
greatest
piece
of
work
,
it
allowed
him
to
become
more
familiar
with
this
type
of
methodology
and
led
him
to
explain
elementary
social
behavior.
in
this
work
,
homans
also
proposes
that
social
reality
should
be
described
at
three
levels
:
social
events
,
customs
,
and
analytical
hypotheses
that
describe
the
processes
by
which
customs
arise
and
are
maintained
or
changed.
hypotheses
are
formulated
in
terms
of
relationships
among
variables
such
as
frequency
of
interaction
,
similarity
of
activities
,
intensity
of
sentiment
,
and
conformity
to
norms.
using
notable
sociological
and
anthropological
field
studies
as
the
grounding
for
such
general
ideas
,
the
book
makes
a
persuasive
case
for
treating
groups
as
social
systems
that
can
be
analyzed
in
terms
of
a
verbal
analogue
of
the
mathematical
method
of
studying
equilibrium
and
stability
of
systems.
in
his
theoretical
analyses
of
these
groups
,
he
begins
to
use
ideas
that
later
loomed
large
in
his
work
,
e.g.
,
reinforcement
and
exchange.
along
the
way
,
he
treats
important
general
phenomena
such
as
social
control
,
authority
,
reciprocity
,
and
ritual.
==
the
exchange
theory
==
the
exchange
theory
is
the
``
perspective
that
individuals
seek
to
maximize
their
own
private
gratifications.
it
assumes
that
these
rewards
can
only
be
found
in

thus
people
seek

.
homans
'
exchange
theory
propositions
are
partially
based
on
b.f.
skinner
's
behaviorism.
homans
took
b.f.
skinner
's
propositions
about
pigeon
behavior
and
applied
it
to
human
interactions.the
heart
of
homans
'
exchange
theory
lies
in
propositions
based
on
economic
and
psychological
principles.
according
to
homans
,
they
are
psychological
for
two
reasons
:
first
,
because
they
are
usually
tested
on
people
who
call
themselves
psychologists
and
second
,
because
of
the
level
at
which
they
deal
with
the
individual
in
society.
he
believed
that
a
sociology
built
on
his
principles
would
be
able
to
explain
all
social
behavior.
homans
said
,
``
an
incidental
advantage
of
an
exchange
theory
is
that
it
might
bring
sociology
closer
to
economics
''
(
homans
<year>
:
<integer>
)
.
overall
,
homans
'
exchange
theory
,
``
can
be
condensed
to
a
view
of
the
actor
as
a
rational
profit
seeker.
''
he
regretted
that
his
theory
was
labeled
``
exchange
theory
''
because
he
saw
this
theory
of
social
behavior
as
a
behavioral
psychology
applied
to
specific
situations.
homans
looked
to
émile
durkheim
's
work
for
guidance
as
well
,
but
often
disagreed
in
the
end
with
particular
components
of
durkheim
's
theories.
for
example
,
durkheim
believed
that
although
individuals
are
clearly
the
component
parts
of
society
,
society
is
more
than
the
individuals
who
constitute
it.
he
believed
that
society
could
be
studied
without
reducing
it
to
individuals
and
their
motivations.
homans
,
through
his
exchange
theory
,
believed
that
individual
beings
and
behavior
are
relevant
to
understanding
society.

albert
chavannes
and
the
exchange
theory

although
george
homans
contributed
greatly
to
the
exchange
theory
and
his
work
on
it
is
greatly
admired
,
he
was
not
the
first
person
to
study
this
theory.
``
from
<year>
to
<year>
albert
chavannes
published
in
the
sociologist
a
series
of
papers
titled
'studies
in
sociology
'
which
treated
'the
law
of
exchange
'
and
three
other
social
laws.
''
chavannes
'
work
on
the
theory
was
similar
to
what
homans
did.
however
,
he
focused
more
on
empirical
sociology
,
and
he
did
not
contribute
to
it
in
the
same
way
as
homans
(
knox
<year>
:
<integer>
)
.
although
homans
may
have
not
have
been
the
first
to
work
on
this
theory
,
his
contributions
make
the
exchange
theory
what
it
is
today.
==
social
behavior
==
homans
's
next
major
work
was
social
behavior
:
its
elementary
forms.
he
wrote
this
book
in
<year>
and
revised
it
in
<year>.
this
was
based
on
the
principles
of
behavioral
psychology
,
and
helped
explain
the
``
sub-institutional
,
''
or
elementary
,
forms
of
social
behavior
in
small
groups.
this
explanation
of
social
behavior
first
appeared
in
an
article
homans
published
titled
``
social
behavior
as
exchange
''
in
<year>.
he
believed
his
exchange
theory
was
derived
from
both
behavioral
psychology
and
elementary
economics.homans
had
come
to
the
view
that
theory
should
be
expressed
as
a
deductive
system
,
in
this
respect
falling
under
the
influence
of
the
logical
empiricist
philosophers
of
that
period.
substantively
,
he
argued
that
a
satisfactory
explanation
in
the
social
sciences
is
based
upon
``
propositions
''
—principles—about
individual
behavior
that
are
drawn
from
the
behavioral
psychology
of
the
time.
homans
did
n't
believe
that
new
propositions
are
needed
to
explain
social
behavior.
the
laws
of
individual
behavior
developed
by
skinner
in
his
study
of
pigeons
explain
social
behavior
as
long
as
we
take
into
account
the
complications
of
mutual
reinforcement.
''
social
behavior
is
an
exchange
of
goods
,
material
goods
,
but
also
non-material
ones
,
such
as
the
symbols
of
approval
or
prestige.
persons
that
give
much
to
others
try
to
get
much
from
them
,
and
persons
that
get
much
from
others
are
under
pressure
to
give
much
to
them.
''
(
homans
<year>
:
<integer>
)
.
social
behavior
as
exchange
means
that
a
plurality
of
individuals
,
each
postulated
to
behave
according
to
the
stated
behavioral
principles
,
form
a
system
of
interaction.
social
approval
is
the
basic
reward
that
people
can
give
to
one
another.
in
much
greater
detail
,
he
developed
this
approach
in
his
book
social
behavior
:
its
elementary
forms
(
<year>
,
revised
<year>
)
.
homans
gives
an
example
of
this
type
of
social
behavior
below
:
``
suppose
that
two
men
are
doing
paperwork
jobs
in
an
office.
according
to
the
office
rules
,
each
should
do
his
job
by
himself
,
or
,
if
he
needs
help
,
he
should
consult
the
supervisor.
one
of
the
men
,
whom
we
shall
call

,
is
not
skillful
at
the
work
and
would
get
it
done
better
and
faster
if
he
got
help
from
time
to
time.
in
spite
of
the
rules
he
is
reluctant
to
go
to
the
supervisor
,
for
to
confess
his
incompetence
might
hurt
his
chances
for
promotion.
instead
he
seeks
out
the
other
man
,
whom
we
shall
call
other
for
short
,
and
asks
him
for
help.
other
is
more
experienced
at
the
work
than
is
person
;
he
can
do
his
work
well
and
quickly
and
be
left
with
time
to
spare
,
and
he
has
reason
to
suppose
that
the
supervisor
will
not
go
out
of
his
way
to
look
for
a
breach
of
rules.
other
gives
person
help
and
in
return
person
gives
other
thanks
and
expressions
of
approval.
the
two
men
have
exchanged
help
and
approval.
''
(
homans
,
<year>
:
<integer>–<integer>
)
focusing
on
this
situation
,
and
basing
his
ideas
on
skinner
's
findings
,
homans
developed
several
propositions.
==
the
success
proposition
==
``
for
all
actions
taken
by
persons
,
the
more
often
a
particular
action
of
a
person
is
rewarded
,
the
more
likely
the
person
is
to
perform
that
action.
''
(
homans
,
<year>
:
<integer>
)
in
terms
of
his
``
person-other
''
example
,
this
proposition
means
that
a
person
is
more
likely
to
ask
others
for
advice
if
past
advice
has
been
useful.
also
,
the
more
often
a
person
received
useful
advice
in
the
past
,
the
more
often
they
will
request
more
advice
and
be
willing
to
give
advice.
the
success
proposition
involves
three
stages
:
(
<integer>
)
a
person
's
action
,
(
<integer>
)
a
rewarded
result
,
and
(
<integer>
)
a
repetition
of
the
original
action.
==
the
stimulus
proposition
==
``
if
in
the
past
the
occurrence
of
a
particular
stimulus
,
or
set
of
stimuli
,
has
been
the
occasion
on
which
a
person
's
action
has
been
rewarded
,
then
the
more
similar
the
present
stimuli
are
to
the
past
ones
,
the
more
likely
the
person
is
to
perform
the
action
,
or
some
similar
action.
''
(
homans
,
<year>
:
<integer>
)
one
may
look
at
homans
'
example
:
if
in
the
past
,
the
person
and
other
found
the
giving
and
getting
of
advice
rewarding
,
they
are
likely
to
engage
in
similar
actions
and
in
similar
situations
in
the
future.
homans
'
example
:
``
a
fisherman
who
has
cast
his
line
into
a
dark
pool
and
has
caught
a
fish
becomes
more
apt
to
fish
in
dark
pools
again
''
(
<year>
:
<integer>
)
.
homans
was
interested
in
the
process
of
generalization
,
or
the
tendency
to
extend
behavior
to
similar
circumstances
;
but
he
was
also
concerned
with
the
process
of
discrimination.
for
example
,
person
and
other
may
only
give
useful
advice
in
the
same
room
as
in
the
past
because
they
think
that
particular
situation
brought
the
most
success.
==
the
value
proposition
==
``
the
more
valuable
to
a
person
is
the
result
of
his
action
,
the
more
likely
he
is
to
perform
the
action.
''
(
homans
,
<year>
:
<integer>
)
if
the
rewards
each
offers
to
the
other
are
considered
valuable
,
the
actors
are
more
likely
to
perform
the
desired
behaviors
than
they
are
if
the
rewards
are
not
valuable.
homans
introduced
the
concepts
of
rewards
and
punishments.
rewards
are
actions
with
positive
values
and
punishments
are
actions
with
negative
values.
rewards
can
either
be
materialistic
(
money
)
or
altruistic
(
helping
others
)
he
found
punishment
to
be
an
inefficient
means
of
getting
people
to
change
their
behavior
,
because
people
may
react
in
undesirable
ways
to
punishment.
==
the
deprivation-satiation
proposition
==
``
the
more
often
in
the
recent
past
a
person
has
received
a
particular
reward
,
the
less
valuable
any
further
unit
of
that
reward
becomes
for
him.
''
(
homans
,
<year>
:
<integer>
)
in
the
office
,
person
and
other
may
reward
each
other
so
often
for
giving
and
getting
advice
that
the
rewards
cease
to
be
valuable
to
them.
time
is
important—people
are
less
likely
to
become
satiated
if
particular
rewards
are
stretched
over
a
long
period
of
time.
homans
then
defined
cost
and
profit.
cost
of
any
behavior
is
defined
as
the
rewards
lost
in
forgoing
alternative
lines
of
action.
profit
in
social
exchange
is
seen
as
the
greater
number
of
rewards
gained
over
costs
incurred.
==
the
aggression-approval
propositions

``

''
(
homans

when
earlier
propositions
rely
on
behaviorism
,
the
rationality

demonstrates
the
influence
of
rational

theory
on
homans
'
approach.
in
economic
terms
,
actors
who
act

accord
with
the
rationality
proposition
are
maximizing
their
utilities.
people
examine
and
make
calculations
about
alternative

they
compare

words
,
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
value
of

attainment.
the
rationality
proposition
tells
us
that
people
will
perform
an
action
depending
on
their
perception
of
the
probability
of
success.
durkheim
agreed
with
homans
'
understanding
of
rationality.
he
believed
that
rationalism
is
an
aspect
of
individualism.
durkheim
said
that
all
development
of
individualism
has
the
effect
of
opening
moral
consciousness
to
new
ideas
and
rendering
it
more
demanding.
homans
worked
off
of
durkheim

thoughts

the

much
attention

skilled

reform
always
can
be
successful
in
some
sense.
but
then
people
jump
from
this
to
something
that’s
going
to
operate
across
the
board
and
reform
the
whole
industrial
system.
they
forget
the
homans
principle
that
no
society
,
no
governmental
system
,
or
no
industrial
system
can
work
successfully
if
it
depends
on
extraordinary
abilities
on
the
part
of
the
people
who
run
it.
it
has
to
be
operable
by
ordinary
damn
fools
like
me.
''
''
in
human
terms
,
it
is
hopeless.
all
of
us
believe
in
determinism
at
times—that
is
,
experimentally
believe
in
it.
at
other
times
,
we
believe
we’re
free.
our
behavior
is
completely
,
but
it
doesn’t
make
damn
bit
of
difference
to
me
because
i
can’t
predict
it.
i
can’t
show
how
the
behavior
of
different
men
,
behavior
of
exemplifying
the
same
general
propositions
,
combines
over
time
to
produce
particular
results.
the
trouble
is
that
the
past
behavior
that
affects—determines
if
you
will—present
behavior
is
linked
together
in
complex
chains
,
creating
the
illusion
of
freedom.

saw
the
introduction

kenyans

always
lived

the

driven
by

during
the
fund
raising
walk
across
the
african

werikhe
never
carried
money

relied
on
the
goodwill
of
the
ordinary
kenyans
living
in
the
bush
to
feed
and
shelter
him.
the
rural

were
werikhe
's
initial
target
group.
rural
people
aware

within

provided
the

line

defence
against

appointed
him
prime

presented

to

as
``
the

''
(

at

he
was

conflict
which
divided
the

majority
between
the
``
giscardians
''
and
the
neo-gaullist
rally
for
the

(
rpr

led
by
his
predecessor
jacques
chirac.
the
right
majority
unexpectedly
won
the
<year>
legislative
election.
barre
was
primarily
confronted
with
an
economic
crisis.
he
advocated
numerous
complex
,
strict
policies
(
``
barre
plans
''
)
.
the
first
barre
plan
emerged
on
<day>
,
with
a
priority
to
stop

it
included
a

price
freeze

tax
;
wage
controls
;

;
and
increases
in

and
bank

there
were
measures
to
restore
the
trade
balance
,
and
support
the
growth
of
the
economy
and
employment.
oil
imports
,
whose
price
had
shot
up
,
were
limited.
there
was
special
aid
to
exports
,
and
an
action
fund
was
set
up
to
aid
industries.
there
was
increased
financial
aid
to
farmers
,
who
were
suffering
from
a
drought
,
and
for
social
security.
the
package
was
not
very
popular
,
but
was
pursued
with
vigor.in
the
face
of
trade
union
opposition
,
he
did
not
use
diplomatic
language.
instead
he
mocked
``
the
bearers
of
banners
''
(
french
:
les
porteurs
de
pancartes
)
and
he
exhorted
``
instead

''
.
===
post-premiership
===
after
his
departure
from

he
was
elected
deputy
of
rhône
département
under
the
label
of
the
union
for
french
democracy
(
udf
)
,
although
he
never
formally
joined

he
held
his
parliamentary
seat
until
<year>.
in
the
<year>s
,
he
competed
for
the
leadership
of
the
right
against
chirac.
believing
that
the
``
cohabitation
''
was
incompatible
with
the
``
fifth
republic
''
,
he
let
chirac
take
the
lead
of
the
cabinet
after
the
<year>
legislative
election.
he
ran
as
udf
candidate
for
president
in
the
<year>
election
,
but
some
components
of
his
party
supported
covertly
the
other
right-wing
candidate
,
the
neo-gaullist
prime
minister
jacques
chirac.
in
this
,
in
spite
of
positive
polls
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
,
he
came
the
third
behind
the
two
protagonists
of
the
``
cohabitation
''
:
the
socialist
president
françois
mitterrand
and
jacques
chirac.
for
the
second
round
,
he
called
his
voters
to
transfer
to
the
rpr
candidate
,
who
was
finally
defeated.
after
the
failure
of
his
presidential
candidacy
,
he
focused
on
his
local
tenures
,
in
lyon.
in
<year>
,
the
rpr
mayor
of
lyon
michel
noir
could
not
compete
for
another

in

to
a
judicial
indictment

consequently
,
barre
was
the
conservative
candidate
to
the
mayoralty.
he
was
elected
but
he
did
not
run
for
a
second
term
in
<year>.
one
year
later
,
he
finished
his
last
parliamentary
term
in
the
french
national
assembly
and
retired
from
politics.
raymond
barre
was
probably
the
only
french
politician
to
have
reached
such
high
levels
of
responsibilities
without
having
ever
been
an
official
member
or
leader
of
any
political
party.
he
always
kept
some
distance
with
what
he
considered
to
be
the
political
``
microcosm
''
.
raymond

allegations
of
antisemitism
==
on
several
occasions
,
raymond
barre
made
remarks
that
were
interpreted
as
antisemitic
,
or
at
least
supportive
of
antisemitism.
in
<year>
,
when
he
was
prime
minister
,
a
bombing
was
attempted
against
the
union
libérale
israélite
de
france
,
a
synagogue
in
the
rue
copernic
,
paris
;
however
the
bomb
detonated
in
the
street
when
the
jews
attending
shabbat
were
inside
the
synagogue
,
and
not
when
they
were
out
;
but
as
a
result
some
non-jewish
bystanders
were
killed.
raymond
barre
then
famously
denounced
:
``
a
hateful
attack
which
wanted
to
strike
at
the
jews
who
were
in
that
synagogue
,
and
which
struck
innocent
french
people
who
were
crossing
the
street.
''
in
<year>
,
barre
argued
on
a
radio
show
that
``
the
jewish
lobby
''
had
orchestrated
criticism
regarding
his
<year>
remarks.
on
this
same
show
,
barre
defended
the
collaborationist
maurice
papon
at
his
trial
,
describing
him
as
``
a
scapegoat.
''
barre
was
criticized
for
these
remarks.

early
life
==
malina
was
born
in
brenham
,
texas.

education
began
with
a
degree
in
mechanical
engineering
from
texas
a
&
m
university
in
<year>.
the

year
he
received
a
scholarship

study
mechanical
engineering
at
the
california
institute
of
technology

,
where
he
obtained
his
doctor
degree
in
<year>.
in
<year>
,
while
a
graduate
student
at

,
malina
persuaded
professor
of
aeronautics
theodore
von
kármán
to
allow
him
to
pursue
studies
into
rocketry
and
rocket
propulsion.
the
formal
goal
was
development
of
a
sounding
rocket.
malina
and
five
associates
(
including
jack
parsons
and
hsue-shen
tsien
)
became
known
at
caltech
as
the
``
suicide
squad
''
because
of
their
dangerous
experiments
(
and
failures
)
when
testing
rocket
motor
designs.
malina
's
group
was
forced
to
move
their
operations
away
from
the
main
caltech
campus
into
the
more
remote
arroyo
seco.
this
site
and
the
research
malina
was
conducting
would
later
become
the
jet
propulsion
laboratory
(
jpl
)
.
malina
served
as
the
second
director
of
jpl.in
<year>
,
the
société
astronomique
de
france
(
french
astronomical
society

malina
's
demanding

,
along
with
a
dislike
of
so
much
rocketry
research
being
devoted
to
weapons
systems
and
not
scientific
research
,
caused
him
to
re-evaluate
his

an
expert
on

,
to
compile
documents
related
to
the
involvement
of
alexandru
drăghici
in
lucrețiu
pătrășcanu
's
execution
;
this
was
part
of
a
wider
effort
to
sideline
his
rival
drăghici.
between
<year>
and
<year>
,
patilineț
was
the
central
committee
member
in
charge
of
the
securitate
secret
police
and
the
romanian
army.
when
students
at
the
university
of
bucharest
demonstrated
on
christmas
eve
<year>
,
he
and
mayor
dumitru
popa
initially
avoided
using
force
,
seeming
to
defuse
the
crisis
but
later
taking
measures
against
the
ringleaders.
ceaușescu
believed
the
protest
should
have
been
forcibly
dispersed
from
the
start
,
and
sharply
criticized
his
subordinates
for
their
approach.
patilineț
was
a
member
of
the
defense
council
from
april
<year>
to
december
<year>.following
the
late
<year>
arrest
of
general
ion
șerb
on
charges
of
spying
for
the
soviet
union
,
patilineț
was
removed
from
supervision
of
defense
and
security
affairs.
he
then
held
two
ministerial
posts
within
the
government
:
forest
economy
and
construction
materials
(
january
<year>
–
december
<year>
)
and
mines
,
petroleum
and
geology
(
december
<year>
–
december
<year>
)
.
he
may
have
been
named
to
the
latter
position
because
ceaușescu
changed
his
mind
about
his
handling
of
the
christmas
eve
incident.
his
predecessor
,
constantin
băbălău
,
had
shown
himself
unable
to
handle
the
jiu
valley
miners
'
strike
of
<year>
,
during
which
he
was
taken
captive
,
and
it
is
possible
that
ceaușescu
recalled
patilineț
'
superior
ability
in
managing
crises.
by
mid-<year>
,
ceaușescu
,
shaken
by
the
defection
of
ion
mihai
pacepa
,
was
keeping
close
surveillance
on
numerous
high-ranking
figures
,
patilineț
included.
thus
,
the
securitate
reported
that
he
was
having
affairs
with
numerous
women
,
which
included
sexual
encounters
in

that

conspiratorial
activity
and
death
===
in
the
late
<year>s
,
as
ceaușescu
grew
increasingly
despotic
,
patilineț
was
the
most
significant
of
several
important
figures
who
began
considering
ways
to
remove
the
leader
,
including
through
assassination.
he
began
serving
as
romania
's
ambassador
to
turkey
in
june
<year>.
in
<year>–<year>
,
he
reportedly
held
discussions
with
the
soviet
ambassador
to
turkey
regarding
the
possibility
of
obtaining
soviet
aid
in
mounting
a
coup
to
depose
ceaușescu.
according
to
testimony
offered
by
military
officer
nicolae
radu
in
<year>
,
a
plot
for
ceaușescu
's
arrest
existed
in
autumn
<year>
,
and
patilineț
handled
the
procurement
of
arms
for
the
conspirators
,
whose
plan
was
foiled
by
an
informer.
it
is
believed
that
patilineț
was
scheduled
to
play
a
vital
role
in
any
post-ceaușescu
government.in
october
<year>
,
after
completing
his
ambassadorial
mission
,
patilineț
was
driving
his
car
from
ankara
to
drop
off
his
car
at
istanbul.
as
he
passed
on
the
road
through
kızılcıkorman
village
in
sakarya
province
,
he
swerved
suddenly
and
hit
a
truck
head-on.
the
accident
was
considered
suspicious
;
gheorghe
apostol
claimed
that
securitate
agents
slipped
a
drug
into
his
whisky
glass
prior
to
departure.
nevertheless
,
no
proof
exists
that
the
death
constituted
an
assassination
ordered
from
above.

he
was
a

,
an
alternate

and
an
alternate

within

in
<year>.his
daughter
amalia
,
nicknamed
maia
,
died
in
the
<year>s
as
the
result
of
an
abortion.
according
to
vladimir
tismăneanu
,
this
took
place
at
bucharest
's
elias
hospital
,
where
relatives
of
the
party
elite
could
obtain
the
procedure
in
spite
of
its
being
banned.
however
,
the
son
of
paul
niculescu-mizil
,
serghei
,
has
stated
that
the
devotion
of
maia
's
father
to
ceaușescu
prevented
her
from
accessing
elias
,
and
that
her
death
resulted
from
a
clandestine
abortion.
when
the
ban
was
imposed
in
<year>
and
alexandru
bârlădeanu
voiced
his
opposition
,
patilineț
had
promptly
accused
him
of
having
a
mistress.
years
later
,
bârlădeanu
described
maia
's
death
as
divine
punishment
for
patilineț
'
slavish
devotion
to
ceaușescu
,
including
on
the
abortion
issue.
this
sentiment
reportedly
began
turning
to
hatred
following
the
loss
of
his
daughter.
according
to
pacepa
,
the
event
also
played
a
role
in
his
demotion
to
the
minor
position
of
forestry
minister.
patilineț
was
in
cairo
at
the
time
of
the
abortion
,
and
nicolae
and
elena
ceaușescu
,
enraged
that
a
close
aide
would
break
a
cherished
law
of
theirs
,
ordered
pacepa
to
send
a
special
airplane
to
bring
him
home.
they
immediately
summoned
and
verbally
abused
him
,
with
elena
being
especially
harsh.
the
grief-stricken
patilineț
responded
furiously
,
and
was
demoted
after
the
funeral.

with
his
french

,
during

charles

broke
away
from

,
first
joining
the

and
subsequently
the

in

to
his
studies
in

,
he
also
learned
russian.
in

,
he
arrived
in
moscow
with
a
tourist
visa.
thanks
to
his
mastery
of
the
language
,
he
was
able
to
get
a
resident
permit
for
five
months

on
with
the
french
edition
of
the
moscow
journal
,
and
finally
at

,
where
he
directed
film
dubbing.
his
experiences
during

moscow
stay
,
in
the
anxious
atmosphere
at
the
beginning
of
the
``
purges
''
and
the
trials
of
the
bolshevik
leaders
who
opposed
joseph
stalin
,
made
him
keep
a
critical
distance
from
the
soviet
union
,
without
actually
abandoning
his
communist
convictions.
he
was
excluded
from
the
communist
party
for
his
``
slanderous
''
remarks.
in
<year>
,
he
married
a
young
militant
communist
,
lucette
beauvallet.
during
the
german
occupation
,
he
cooperated
with
the
french
trotskyists
(
the
internationalist
workers
party
)
.
his
decision
to
choose
economics
as
a
profession
was
not
an
easy
one
,
since
at
that
time
economics
was
considered
a
minor
science
;
however
,
inasmuch
as
he
had
become
so
knowledgeable
about
the
soviet
union
and
about
economic
planning
,
bettelheim
was
able
to
fill
a
gap.
after
world
war
ii
,
he
became
an
official
in

activities
as
an
advisor
to
the
governments
of
third

countries
;
he
was
the

,
for
jawaharlal
nehru
in

,
and
for
ahmed
ben

,
he
created
an
institutional
base
for
his
research
by
founding
the
cemi.
in
<year>
,
che
guevara
invited
him
to
cuba
,
where
he
participated
in
a
``
grand
debate
''
on

in
<year>
,
bettelheim
was
particularly
interested

helped
the

(
marxist–leninist
)

theoretical
planning

in

several
times
,
in
order
to
study
new
methods
of
industrial
development
created
by
the
cultural

after
the
death
of
mao
zedong
in
<year>
,
bettelheim
was
very
critical
of
the
new
leaders
(
hua
guofeng
and
deng
xiaoping
)
who
began
to
abandon
maoist
principles
,
and
replacing
them
with
a
politics

modernization
which
bettelheim
considered
reactionary
and
authoritarian.
from
<year>
onward
,
bettelheim
fell
more
and
more
by
the
wayside—a
result
of
the
profound
political
changes
in
the
third
world—and
,
in
europe
,
of
the
decline
(
and
eventual
dissolution
)
of
``
hard-line
socialism
''
,
which
rendered
``
obsolete
''
any
debate
over

in
an
atmosphere

economy
to
which
bettelheim
had
contributed
so
much.
bettelheim

written
a

despite
his
negative
experiences
in
moscow
,
bettelheim
retained
a
favorable
attitude
towards
soviet
socialism
until
the
sixties
,
citing
the
economic
accomplishments
of
the
soviet
union
,
which
he
appreciated
from
an
independent
point
of
view.
in
<year>
,
he
endorsed
the
de-stalinization
inaugurated
by
nikita
khrushchev
at
the
twentieth
congress
of
the
soviet
communist
party
,
as
well
as
the
reforms
conceived
by

,
suggesting
a
decentralization
of
decisions
made
within
the
planning
leadership.
===
from
the
cuban
debate
to
the
critique
of
``
economism
''
===
in
the
cuban
debate
of
<year>
,
bettelheim
was
opposed
to
the
voluntarist
ideas
of
che
guevara
,
who
wanted
to
abolish
free
market
and
the
production
of
merchandise
through
a
very
rapid
and
centralized
industrialization
,
morally
mobilizing
``
the
new
man.
''
bettelheim
took
a
position
against
this
plan
,
to
which
fidel
castro
had
also
subscribed
:
both
che
guevara
and
castro
preferred
the
monoculture
of
sugar
as
the
basis
of
cuban
economy
,
rather
than
a
strict
analogy
to
the
economy
of
the
soviet
union.
in
cuba
,
bettelheim
recommended
a
diversified
economy
,
based
on
agriculture
,
prudent
industrialization
,
broad
central
planning
,
mixed
forms
of
property
ownership
with
market
elements—a
pragmatic
strategy
similar
to
the
``
new
economic
policy
''
begun
in
russia
by
vladimir
lenin
in
<year>.
opposing
guevara
,
bettelheim
argued
(
in
line
with
the
last
writings
of
stalin
)
that
the
``
law
of
value
''
was
the
manifestation
of
objective
social
conditions
which
could
not
be
overcome
by
willful
decisions
,
but
only
by
a
process
of
long-term
social
transformation.
this
debate
demonstrated
the
profound
differences
which
,
from
then
on
,
separated
bettelheim
from
marxist
``
orthodoxy
''
,
which
considered
socialism
as
the
result
of
``
the
development
of
maximum
centralization
of
all
forces
of
industrial
production
''
.
for
bettelheim
,
socialism
is
rather
an
alternative
voice
in
development
;
a
process
of
transformation
of
social
understandings.
inspired
by
the
chinese
cultural
revolution
and
the
thought
of
mao
zedong
,
and
in
cooperation
with
the
marxist
philosopher
louis
althusser
,
bettelheim
was
opposed
to
``
economism
''
and
to
the
``
primacy
of
the
means
of
production
''
of
traditional
marxism
:
against
the
idea
that
socialist
transformation
of
social
bonds
was
a
necessary
effect
of
the
development
of
the
forces
of
production
(
liberating
those
bonds
from
them
,
according
to
marxist
orthodoxy
,
since
private
property
dominates
them
in
``
bourgeois
''
society
)
,
he
affirmed
the
necessity
for
actively
and
politically
transforming
social
connections.
in
his
book
economic
calculations
and
forms
of
ownership
(
calcul
économique
et
formes
de
proprieté
)
,
bettelheim
re-thinks
the
problems
of
transition
to
socialism
,
while
criticizing
the
supposition
that
nationalization
and
state
ownership
of
the
means
of
production
was
already
``
socialist
''
—it
is
not
the
legal
form
of
property
,
but
true
socialization
of
the
web
of
production
,
which
characterizes
such
a
transition
;
the
crucial
problem
in
socialist
planning
is
the
replacement
of
the
form
of
``
value
''
with
the
development
of
a
method
of
measurement
which
takes
into
account
the
social
utility
of
production.
===
chinese
experience
and
analysis
of
the
soviet
union
===
in
china
,
bettelheim
had
the
impression
that
he
was
in
the
process
of
witnessing
just
such
a
process
of
transformation.
more
specifically
,
he
noted
that
the
cultural
revolution—a
revolution
of
the
political
,
ideological
and
cultural
superstructure—changed
the
industrial
organization
accompanying
it
by
a
general
participation
by
the
workers
in
all
decisions
,
and
overcoming
the
division
of
``
manual
''
and
``
intellectual
''
labor.
during
these
years
,
china
was
the
benchmark
for
the
neo-marxist
``
radical
school
of
economics
''
,
represented
by
bettelheim
,
paul
sweezy
,
andre
gunder
frank
,
samir
amin
and
others
who
,
by
fighting
against
theories
of
``
modernization
,
''
affirmed
that
at
the
periphery
of
the
worldwide
capitalist
system
,
in
``
under-developed
''
countries
,
``
development
''
is
only
possible
under
conditions
where
these
countries
pry
themselves
free
from
their
unequal
and
asymmetrical
connections
with
the
world
market
,
dominated
by
imperialist
countries
,
in
order
to
choose
a
different
and
autonomous
path
:
a
development
of
production
neither
for
profit
,
nor
for
an
accumulation
of
abstract
wealth
,
but
for
the
needs
of
the
people.
under
the
banner
of
such
a
``
maoist
''
approach
,
bettelheim
began
his
voluminous
work
on
the
history
of
the
soviet
union
:
les
luttes
de
classes
en
urss
(
<year>–<year>
)
(
class
struggle
in
the
ussr
(
<year>–<year>
)
)
,
where
he
examines
the
reasons
for
the
distortions
of
soviet
socialism
,
which
,
according
to
bettelheim
,
is
nothing
more
than
a
``
state
capitalism.
''
bettelheim
showed
that
after
the
october
revolution
,
the
bolsheviks
had
not
succeeded
in
any
long-term
stabilization
of
the
alliance
between
workers
and
poor
peasants
which
had
earlier
been
conceived
by
lenin.
during
the
<year>s
,
this
alliance
was
replaced
by
an
alliance
of
elite
workers
and
technological
intellectuals
against
the
peasants
,
culminating
in
the
forced
collectivization
of
agriculture
in
<year>.
``
economistic
''
ideology
(
the
``
primacy
of
the
forces
of
production
''
)
,
born
in
social-democracy
and
fed
by
the
interests
of
the
``
worker
aristocracy
''
and
progressivist
intellectuals
,
was
resurrected
by
the
enablement
of
the
bolshevik
party
,
acting
as
a
legitimization
of
new
technocratic
elites
which
established
the
same
divisions
of
labor
and
social
differentiations
,
as
had
capitalism.
however
,
the
``
legal
''
mirage
,
according
to
which
the
property
of
the
state
is
defined
as
``
socialist
,
''
hides
the
actual
exploitation.
finally
,
bettelheim
called
into
doubt
the
socialist
character
of
the
october
revolution
,
interpreting
it
as
a
seizing
of
power
by
a
radical
branch
of
the
russian
intelligentsia
,
which
``
confiscated
''
a
popular
revolution.bettelheim
was
a
leading
proponent
of
the
thesis
that
``
development
''
in
the
countries
of
the
``
third
world
''
necessitates
a
political
break
with
imperialism
and
a
distantanglement
from
the
bonds
of
dependency
on
the
unequal
international
division
of
labor
of
the
world
market.
this
position
also
includes
a
sharp
criticism
of
the
international
role
of
the
soviet
union
whose
politics
of
development
bettelheim
saw
as
just
another
variant
of
capitalist
accumulation
models.
this
theory
saw
a
chance
for
a
disentanglement
of
the
political
groundwork
in
order
to
practice
an
alternative
development
model
,
one
that
was
not
oriented
towards
accumulation
and
profit
,
but
rather
towards
an
economy
for
the
everyday
needs
of
the
people
,
with
a
balanced
proportion
allowed
between
agriculture
and
industry.

himself
unpopular
with
a
speech
to
students
that
was
published
in
the
scotsman
with
the
headline
,
``
scottish
university
sitting
on
haunches
for
the
last
fifty
years.
''
in
those
days
boulding
was
actively
involved
in
the
quaker
community
,
writing
a
pamphlet
on
nonviolent
methods
in
<year>
and
drafting
a
letter
for
the
friends
to
the
prime
minister
,
asking
britain
to
disclaim
the
``
war
guilt
''
clauses
in
the
treaty
of
versailles
and
move
toward
a
more
just
peace.during
this
period
boulding
learned
about
paton
's
accounting
theory
and
the
principles
of
accounting.
this
theory
made
him
view
the
firm
as
``
governed
by
a
principle
that
might
be
called
the
homeostasis
of
the
constant
changing
balance
sheet
''
.
boulding
(
<year>
)
explained
that
:
``
in
the
short
run
,
the
firm
simply
responded
to
changes
in
the
balance
sheet
resulting
from
purchases.
when
customers
purchased
finished
goods
,
inventory
went
down
,
cash
went
up
,
and
the
cash
would
be
spent
on
labour
and
materials
to
make
more
finished
goods.
this
equilibrium
balance
sheet
,
however
,
would
be
constantly
changing
as
technologies
,
new
goods
,
and
new
enterprises
came
into
play.
''
:
<integer>–<day>
,
in

in

,
frank
h.

published
an
article
on

of
investment
once
more
:
mr.
boulding

,
''
in
the

this
brought
boulding
at
the
age

to
prominence
as
a
notable
intellectual
in
the
social

boulding
returned
to
the

to
attend
a
world
congress
of
quakers
in
philadelphia.
he
obtained
a
faculty
position
in
upstate

at
colgate
university.
:
<integer>
from
<year>
to
<year>
he
taught

there.
fontaine
(
<year>
)
summarized
his
stay
:
...
boulding
enjoyed
the
congenial
surroundings
of
colgate
university.
he
did
not
feel
alienated
from
his
colleagues
and
acquaintances
,
as
he
had
in
british
academic
circles.
for
the
first
two
years
,
social
and
professional
life
was
fulfilling.
but
from
september
<year>
,
the
invasion
of
poland
and
his
home
country
's
declaration
of
war
on
germany
caused
increasing
emotional
distress
and
strong
feelings
of
hate
against
the
germans.
his
quaker
convictions
were
shaken
until
he
had
a
mystical
experience
in
may
<year>
which
restored
his
faith
in
pacifism
...
:
<integer>
in
a
state
of
spiritual
crisis
boulding
managed
to
finish
his
textbook
,
economic
analysis
,
which
he
had
started
in
the
free
summer
semesters
at
colgate
in
the
previous
two
years.
this
work
would
become
a
bestseller
:
<integer>
and
earned
him
even
more
respect
in
the
field
of
economics.

boulding
taught
at

larry

stated
:
the
election
of
kenneth
boulding
as
president-elect
of
the
aaas
continues
the
tradition
of
selecting
an
individual
who
is
not
only
distinguished
because
of
significant
and
fundamental
contributions
to
a
particular
field
of
science
but
who
also
has
the
knowledge
and
vision
to
look
at
science
as
a
whole
and
accordingly
to
represent
the
entire
scientific
community.
boulding
was
nominated
for
the
nobel
prize
at
different
times
for
both
peace

economics.
===
religious
society

===
boulding
,
with
his
wife
elise
,
was
an
active
member
of
the
religious
society
of
friends
,
or
quakers.
he
took
part
in
quaker
gatherings
,
served
on
committees
,
and
spoke
to
and
about
the
friends.
the
two
were
members
of
meetings
in
nashville
,
ann
arbor
,
and
boulder.
although
he
usually
stuttered
,
when
he
ministered
at
a
friends
meeting
,
he
spoke
fluently.
kenneth
boulding
was
instrumental
in
organizing
the
first
vietnam
war
teach-in
at
the
university
of
michigan
in
march
,
<year>.
he
later
spoke
on
the
steps
of
the
hatcher
graduate
library
at
the
university
and
was
pelted
with
snowballs
by
a
group
of
disagreeing
students.
in
march
<year>
,
he
conducted
a
silent
vigil
at
the
headquarters
of
the
american
friends
service
committee
in
philadelphia
to
protest
what
he
considered
its
distancing
itself
from
quakers.
he
penned
the
widely
circulated
``
there
is
a
spirit
''
,
a
series
of
sonnets
he
wrote
in
<year>
based
on
the
last
statement
of
the
<integer>th
century
quaker
james
nayler.
==
work
==
boulding
was
widely
recognized
in
academia
as
a
prolific
writer
and
an
integrator
of
knowledge.
for
boulding
,
economics
and
sociology
were
not
social
sciences—
rather
,
they
were
all
aspects
of
a
single
social
science
devoted
to
the
study
of
human
persons
and
their
relationships
(
organizations
)
.
boulding
spearheaded
an
evolutionary
(
instead
of
equilibrium
)
approach
to
economics.
boulding
emphasized
that
human
economic
and
other
behavior
is
embedded
in
a
larger
interconnected
system.
to
understand
the
results
of
our
behavior
,
economic
or
otherwise
,
we
must
first
research
and
develop
a
scientific
understanding
of
the
ecodynamics
of
the
general
system
,
the
global
society
in
which
we
live
,
in
all
its
dimensions
spiritual
and
material.
boulding
believed
that
in
the
absence
of
a
committed
effort
to
the
right
kind
of
social
science
research
and
understanding
,
the
human
species
might
well
be
doomed
to
extinction.
but
he
was
optimistic
,
believing
our
evolutionary
journey
had
just
begun.
===
economic
analysis
,
<year>
===
boulding
's
first
major
work
in
economics
was
his
introductory
textbook
,
entitled
economic
analysis.
it
was
written
when
he
was
an
instructor
at
colgate
university
in
the
late-<year>s
and
first
appeared
in
<year>
from
harper
&
brothers
in
single-volume
and
two-volume
editions.
the
book
was
augmented
and
republished
in
four
editions
,
the
last
in
<year>.
in
a
<year>
book
review
,
max
millikan
pointed
out
that
the
book
was
published
at
the
right
time
and
the
right
place.
according
to
millikan
:
for
some
years
there
has
been
a
yawning
gap
in
the
literature
of
economic
theory
between
the
very
elementary
text
designed
for
beginning
students
and
the
clutter
of
specialized
monographs
and
periodical
articles
accessible
only
to
the
fully
trained
economist.
the
teacher
attempting
to
lead
his
charges
over
this
difficult
and
dangerous
terrain
has
had
to
choose
between
two
unsatisfactory
alternatives.
he
could
devote
all
his
time
to
formal
lecturing
about
a
subject
that
requires
informal
discussion
and
problems
for
its
proper
comprehension
;
or
he
could
assign
and
discuss
a
hodgepodge
of
advanced
books
and
articles
in
the
hope
,
usually
vain
,
that
some
fraction
of
the
class
would
struggle
through
to
a
comprehension
of
some
fraction
of
the
material.
millikan
concluded
that
boulding
's
work
had
filled
the
gap
``
neatly
and
effectively
...
material
is
organized
by
tools
of
analysis
and
the
problems
in
the
solution
of
which
those
tools
are
useful
rather
than
in
the
conventional
manner
''
.
in
the
preface
boulding
had
explained
that
the
book
was
``
intended
as
a
text
from
which
the
student
can
learn
and
the
teacher
can
teach
the
methods
and
results
of
economic
analysis.
it
also
seeks
to
be
a
contribution
to
the
development
and
systematization
of
the
body
of
economic
analysis
itself.
''
looking
back
in
<year>
,
boulding
explained
,
that
``
the
first
edition
fundamentally
followed
irving
fisher
and
keynes
's
treatise
on
money.
even
though
i
had
read
keynes
's
general
theory
by
that
time
,
i
think
i
had
not
really
understood
it.
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
i
do
now.
the
second
edition
,
however
,
in
<year>
,
was
a
thoroughly
keynesian
general
theory.
''
:
<integer>
the
first
edition
was
published
at
the
outbreak
of
world
war
ii
and
did
not
sell
well
,
but
the
second
revised
edition
did
and
became
``
one
of
the
core
textbooks
used
in
college
in
the
united
states
(
and
eventually
around
the
world
)
.
''
:

===
evolutionary

===
boulding
was
an
exponent
of
the
evolutionary
economics
movement.
in
his
``
economic
development
as
an
evolutionary
system
''
(
<year>
,
<year>
)
,
boulding
suggests
a
parallel
between
economic
development
and
biological
evolution.
===
the
economics

the

,
<year>
===
following
the
publication
of
rachel
carson
's
silent
spring
in
<year>
,
the
developing
environmental
movement
drew
attention
to
the
relationship
between
economic
growth
and
development
and
environmental
degradation.
boulding
in
his
influential
<year>
essay
``
the
economics
of
the
coming
spaceship
earth
''
identified
the
need
for
the
economic

fit
itself

its

<year>
)
was
an
american
medical
scientist
best
known
for
his
research
on
tumor
angiogenesis
,
the
process
by
which
a
tumor
attracts
blood
vessels
to
nourish
itself
and
sustain
its
existence.
he
founded
the
field
of
angiogenesis
research
,
which
has
led
to
the
discovery
of
a
number
of
therapies
based
on
inhibiting
or
stimulating
neovascularization.
==
early
life
==
born
in
<year>
in
cleveland
,
ohio
,
judah
folkman
accompanied
his
father
,
a
rabbi
,
on
visits
to
hospital
patients.
by
age
seven
,
he
knew
he
wanted
to
be
a
doctor
rather
than
follow
in
his
father
's
footsteps
,
so
he
could
offer
cures
in
addition
to
comfort.
his
father
replied
,
``
in
that
case
,
you
can
be
a
rabbi-like
doctor
,
''
words
his
son
took
to
heart.
==
career
==
folkman
graduated
from
the
ohio
state
university
in
<year>
,
and
then
harvard
medical
school
in
<year>.
while
a
student
at
harvard
medical
school
,
he
trained
under
robert
edward
gross
and
also
worked
on
a
prototype
pacemaker
,
work
that
he
never
published.
after
his
graduation
,
he
started
his
surgical
residency
at
massachusetts
general
hospital.
in
<year>
his
residency
was
interrupted
when
he
was
drafted
in
the
united
states
navy
and
did
research
for
the
navy
until
<year>
at
the
national
naval
medical
center
in
bethesda
,
maryland.
during
that
time
,
he
studied
the
use
of
silastic
for
the
sustained
release
of
lipophilic
drugs
;
the
<year>
publication
of
that
work
helped
inspire
the
technological
development
of
the
norplant
implantable
contraceptive
at
the
population
council.
:
<integer>
the
navy
research
was
focused
on
developing
artificial
blood
;
in
the
course
of
testing
potential
products
to
see
if
they
could
keep
alive
thymus
glands
taken
from
rabbits
,
he
noticed
that
tumors
in
the
gland
could
n't
grow
,
as
they
did
if
the
glands
were
perfused
with
blood.
his
curiosity
as
to
why
led
to
his
work
on
angiogenesis.after
his
two
years
work
for
the
navy
,
folkman
completed
his
residency
at
massachusetts
general
hospital.
he
worked
as
an
assistant
surgeon
at
boston
city
hospital
,
then
trained
further
in
pediatric
surgery
at
children
's
hospital
of
philadelphia
under
c.
everett
koop.
in
<year>
he
was
appointed
surgeon-in-chief
of
children
's
hospital
boston
at
the
age
of
<integer>.
folkman
was
appointed
the
julia
dyckman
andrus
professor
of
pediatric
surgery
at
harvard
medical
school
in
<year>
,
where
he
was
also
professor
of
cell
biology.
he
was
the
youngest
full
professor
at
harvard
medical
school
in
history.
in
addition
to
directing
the
children
's
hospital
boston
surgical
research
laboratories
,
which
grew
to
become
the
vascular
biology
program
,
for
nearly
four
decades
,
he
was
the
scientific
director
of
the
hospital
's
vascular
anomalies
center.
==
work
on
angiogenesis
==
in
<year>
,
he
reported
in
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine
that
solid
tumors
are
angiogenesis-dependent.
he
hypothesized
that
there
was
an
unknown
``
factor
''
that
tumors
secreted
to
help
it
increase
its
blood
supply
,
and
that
if
that
factor
could
be
blocked
,
tumors
would
wither
and
die.
though
his
hypothesis
was
initially
disregarded
and
treated
with
skepticism
by
most
experts
in
the
field
,
folkman
persisted
with
his
research.
he
and
collaborators
,
who
included
bert
l.
vallee
,
soon
identified
the
already-known
fibroblast
growth
factor
as
an
angiogenic
factor
,
but
the
team
's
work
showed
that
there
were
additional
,
unknown
factors.
to
help
accelerate
the
work
,
folkman
started
collaborating
with
industry.
in
<year>
harvard
university
and
monsanto
signed
a
ten-year
industrial-funded
research
grant
to
support
his
cancer
research
,
which
at
that
time
was
the
largest
such
arrangement
ever
made
;
medical
inventions
arising
from
that
research
were
the
first
for
which
harvard
allowed
its
faculty
to
submit
a
patent
application.
robert
langer
worked
as
a
postdoc
in
folkman
's
lab
during
this
time
,
concentrating
on
using
silastic
and
other
materials
to
deliver
drugs.in
the
mid
to
late
<year>s
,
two
other
angiogenic
factors
were
identified
by
other
labs
that
had
been
inspired
by
his
work
:
angiogenin
and
vegf.
with
the
factors
identified
,
drug
discovery
could
begin.
when
the
monsanto
agreement
(
which
yielded
no
products
for
monsanto
)
ended
,
folkman
started
receiving
research
funding
from
takeda
and
then
from
a
startup
company
,
entremed
,
that
put
half
its
venture
capital
funding
into
research
in
the
folkman
lab.donald
e.
ingber
soon
discovered
that
a
fungus
,
aspergillus
fumigatus
,
secreted
a
chemical
,
fumagillin
,
that
inhibited
angiogenesis.
takeda
performed
medicinal
chemistry
to
optimize
it
,
leading
to
development
of
tnp<integer>.
folkman
's
team
later
tested
it
in
adults
with
hemangiomas
;
they
also
used
interferon
alpha
,
an
already
approved
drug
that
they
had
already
shown
to
be
an
angiogenesis
inhibitor
,
to
treat
infants
with
hemangiomas
in
some
of
the
first
clinical
trials
of
angiogenesis
inhibitors
which
were
published
in
<year>.
in
these
trials
they
also
studied
the
levels
of
fibroblast
growth
factor
in
the
urine
of
the
trial
subjects
and
published
that
work
in
<year>
;
these
were
some
of
the
first
explorations
of
the
use
of
biomarkers
in
clinical
trials
as
surrogate
endpoints.in
<year>
michael
o
''
reilly
,
working
in
the
folkman
lab
with
entremed
funding
,
discovered
the
first
endogenous
angiogenesis
inhibitor
,
angiostatin
and
then
another
,
endostatin.
entremed
began
developing
them
and
soon
struck
a
collaboration
with
bristol-myers
,
which
caught
national
interest
and
spurred
further
investment
in
angiogenesis
inhibitors
by
other
pharma
companies.in
<year>
he
surprised
the
scientific
world
by
hypothesizing
that
angiogenesis
is
as
important
in
blood
cancers
as
it
is
in
solid
tumors
,
and
the
next
year
he
published
work
showing
that
a
biomarker
of
angiogenesis
was
higher
in
all
people
with
cancer
,
but
especially
high
in
people
with
blood
cancers
,
and
other
evidence
of
the
role
of
angiogenesis
in
blood
cancers
emerged
as
well.
meanwhile
,
a
member
of
his
lab
,
robert
d'amato
,
was
looking
for
angiogenesis
inhibitors
,
and
discovered
that
thalidomide
inhibited
angiogenesis
in
<year>.
around
that
time
,
the
wife
of
a
man
who
was
dying
of
multiple
myeloma
and
whom
standard
treatments
had
failed
,
called
folkman
asking
him
about
his
anti-angiogenesis
ideas.
folkman
convinced
the
patient
's
doctor
to
try
thalidomide
,
and
that
doctor
ended
up
conducting
a
clinical
trial
of
thalidomide
for
people
with
multiple
myeloma
in
which
about
a
third
of
the
subjects
responded
to
the
treatment.
the
results
of
that
trial
were
published
in
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine
in
<year>.in
<year>
,
the
first
angiogenesis
inhibitor
,
bevacizumab
(
avastin
)
,
was
approved
by
the
fda
,
as
a
treatment
for
colon
cancer.
it
is
a
recombinant
humanized
monoclonal
antibody
that
was
discovered
and
developed
by
napoleone
ferrara
,
a
scientist
at
genentech.
a
similar
drug
,
lucentis
,
was
later
approved
for
treating
macular
degeneration.
after
further
work
was
done
by
celgene
and
others
,
in
<year>
the
u.s.
food
and
drug
administration
granted
accelerated
approval
for
thalidomide
in
combination
with
dexamethasone
for
the
treatment
of
newly
diagnosed
multiple
myeloma
patients.

decision-making
===
administrative
behavior
,
first
published
in
<year>
and
updated
across
the
years
,
was
based
on
simon
's
doctoral
dissertation.
it
served
as
the
foundation
for
his
life
's
work.
the
centerpiece
of
this
book
is
the
behavioral
and
cognitive
processes
of
humans
making
rational
decisions.
by
his
definition
,
an
operational
administrative
decision
should
be
correct
,
efficient
,
and
practical
to
implement
with
a
set
of
coordinated
means.simon
recognized
that
a
theory
of
administration
is
largely
a
theory
of
human
decision
making
,
and
as
such
must
be
based
on
both
economics
and
on
psychology.
he
states
:
[
if
]
there
were
no
limits
to
human
rationality
administrative
theory
would
be
barren.
it
would
consist
of
the
single
precept
:
always
select
that
alternative
,
among
those
available
,
which
will
lead
to
the
most
complete
achievement
of
your
goals.
(
p
xxviii
)
contrary
to
the
``
homo
economicus
''
stereotype
,
simon
argued
that
alternatives
and
consequences
may
be
partly
known
,
and
means
and
ends
imperfectly
differentiated
,
incompletely
related
,
or
poorly
detailed.simon
defined
the
task
of
rational
decision
making
is
to
select
the
alternative
that
results
in
the
more
preferred
set
of
all
the
possible
consequences.
correctness
of
administrative
decisions
was
thus
measured
by
:
adequacy
of
achieving
the
desired
objective
efficiency
with
which
the
result
was
obtainedthe
task
of
choice
was
divided
into
three
required
steps
:
identifying
and
listing
all
the
alternatives
determining
all
consequences
resulting
from
each
of
the
alternatives
;
comparing
the
accuracy
and
efficiency
of
each
of
these
sets
of
consequencesany
given
individual
or
organization
attempting
to
implement
this
model
in
a
real
situation
would
be
unable
to
comply
with
the
three
requirements.
simon
argued
that
knowledge
of
all
alternatives
,
or
all
consequences
that
follow
from
each
alternative
is
impossible
in
many
realistic
cases.simon
attempted
to
determine
the
techniques
and/or
behavioral
processes
that
a
person
or
organization
could
bring
to
bear
to
achieve
approximately
the
best
result
given
limits
on
rational
decision
making.
simon
writes
:
the
human
being
striving
for
rationality
and
restricted
within
the
limits
of
his
knowledge
has
developed
some
working
procedures
that
partially
overcome
these
difficulties.
these
procedures
consist
in
assuming
that
he
can
isolate
from
the
rest
of
the
world
a
closed
system
containing
a
limited
number
of
variables
and
a
limited
range
of
consequences.
therefore
,
simon
describes
work
in
terms
of
an
economic
framework
,
conditioned
on
human
cognitive
limitations
:
economic
man
and
administrative
man.
administrative
behavior
addresses
a
wide
range
of
human
behaviors
,
cognitive
abilities
,
management
techniques
,
personnel
policies
,
training
goals
and
procedures
,
specialized
roles
,
criteria
for
evaluation
of
accuracy
and
efficiency
,
and
all
of
the
ramifications
of
communication
processes.
simon
is
particularly
interested
in
how
these
factors
influence
the
making
of
decisions
,
both
directly
and
indirectly.simon
argued
that
the
two
outcomes
of
a
choice
require
monitoring
and
that
many
members
of
the
organization
would
be
expected
to
focus
on
adequacy
,
but
that
administrative
management
must
pay
particular
attention
to
the
efficiency
with
which
the
desired
result
was
obtained.simon
followed
chester
barnard
,
who
stated
``
the
decisions
that
an
individual
makes
as
a
member
of
an
organization
are
quite
distinct
from
his
personal
decisions
''
.
personal
choices
may
be
determined
whether
an
individual
joins
a
particular
organization
and
continue
to
be
made
in
his
or
her
extra–organizational
private
life.
as
a
member
of
an
organization
,
however
,
that
individual
makes
decisions
not
in
relationship
to
personal
needs
and
results
,
but
in
an
impersonal
sense
as
part
of
the
organizational
intent
,
purpose
,
and
effect.
organizational
inducements
,
rewards
,
and
sanctions
are
all
designed
to
form
,
strengthen
,
and
maintain
this
identification.simon
saw
two
universal
elements
of
human
social
behavior
as
key
to
creating
the
possibility
of
organizational
behavior
in
human
individuals
:
authority
(
addressed
in
chapter
vii—the
role
of
authority
)
and
in
loyalties
and
identification
(
addressed
in
chapter
x
:
loyalties
,
and
organizational
identification
)
.
authority
is
a
well-studied
,
primary
mark
of
organizational
behavior
,
straightforwardly
defined
in
the
organizational
context
as
the
ability
and
right
of
an
individual
of
higher
rank
to
guide
the
decisions
of
an
individual
of
lower
rank.
the
actions
,
attitudes
,
and
relationships
of
the
dominant
and
subordinate
individuals
constitute
components
of
role
behavior
that
may
vary
widely
in
form
,
style
,
and
content
,
but
do
not
vary
in
the
expectation
of
obedience
by
the
one
of
superior
status
,
and
willingness
to
obey
from
the
subordinate.loyalty
was
defined
by
simon
as
the
``
process
whereby
the
individual
substitutes
organizational
objectives
(
service
objectives
or
conservation
objectives
)
for
his
own
aims
as
the
value-indices
which
determine
his
organizational
decisions
''
.
this
entailed
evaluating
alternative
choices
in
terms
of
their
consequences
for
the
group
rather
than
only
for
oneself
or
one
's
family.decisions
can
be
complex
admixtures
of
facts
and
values.
information
about
facts
,
especially
empirically-proven
facts
or
facts
derived
from
specialized
experience
,
are
more
easily
transmitted
in
the
exercise
of
authority
than
are
the
expressions
of
values.
simon
is
primarily
interested
in
seeking
identification
of
the
individual
employee
with
the
organizational
goals
and
values.
following
lasswell
,
he
states
that
``
a
person
identifies
himself
with
a
group
when
,
in
making
a
decision
,
he
evaluates
the
several
alternatives
of
choice
in
terms
of
their
consequences
for
the
specified
group
''
.
a
person
may
identify
himself
with
any
number
of
social
,
geographic
,
economic
,
racial
,
religious
,
familial
,
educational
,
gender
,
political
,
and
sports
groups.
indeed
,
the
number
and
variety
are
unlimited.
the
fundamental
problem
for
organizations
is
to
recognize
that
personal
and
group
identifications
may
either
facilitate
or
obstruct
correct
decision
making
for
the
organization.
a
specific
organization
has
to
determine
deliberately
,
and
specify
in
appropriate
detail
and
clear
language
,
its
own
goals
,
objectives
,
means
,
ends
,
and
values.simon
has
been
critical
of
traditional
economics
'
elementary
understanding
of
decision-making
,
and
argues
it
``
is
too
quick
to
build
an
idealistic
,
unrealistic
picture
of
the
decision-making
process
and
then
prescribe
on
the
basis
of
such
unrealistic
picture

,
simon
predicted
that

would
surpass
human
chess
abilities
within
``
ten
years
''
when
,
in
reality
,
that
transition
took
about
forty
years.in
the
early
<year>s
psychologist
ulric
neisser
asserted
that
while
machines
are
capable
of
replicating
``
cold
cognition
''
behaviors
such
as
reasoning
,
planning
,
perceiving
,
and
deciding

they
would
never
be
able
to
replicate
``
hot

''
behaviors
such
as
pain
,

,

,
and
other
emotions.
simon
responded
to
neisser
's
views
in
<year>
by
writing
a
paper
on
emotional
cognition
,
which
he
updated
in
<year>
and
published
in

review.
simon
's
work
on
emotional
cognition
was
largely
ignored
by
the
artificial
intelligence
research
community
for
several
years
,
but
subsequent
work
on
emotions
by
sloman
and
picard
helped
refocus
attention
on
simon
's
paper
and
eventually
,
made
it
highly
influential
on
the
topic.simon
also
collaborated
with
james
g.
march
on
several
works
in
organization
theory.with
allen
newell
,
simon
developed
a
theory
for
the
simulation
of
human
problem
solving

rules.
the
study
of

solving
required
new
kinds
of
human
measurements
and
,
with

,
simon
developed
the
experimental
technique
of
verbal
protocol
analysis.
simon
was
interested
in
the
role
of
knowledge
in
expertise.
he
said
that
to
become
an
expert
on
a
topic
required
about
ten
years
of
experience
and
he
and
colleagues
estimated
that
expertise
was
the
result
of
learning
roughly

===
psychology
===
simon
was
interested
in
how
humans
learn
and
,
with
edward
feigenbaum
,
he
developed
the
epam
(
elementary
perceiver
and
memorizer
)
theory
,
one
of
the
first
theories
of
learning
to
be
implemented
as
a

epam
was
able
to
explain
a
large
number

phenomena
in
the
field
of

later
versions
of
the
model
were
applied
to
concept
formation
and
the
acquisition
of
expertise.
with
fernand
gobet
,
he
has
expanded
the
epam
theory
into
the
chrest

the
theory
explains
how
simple

form

===
sociology
and
economics
===
simon
has
been
credited
for
revolutionary
changes
in
microeconomics.
he
is
responsible
for
the
concept
of
organizational
decision-making
as
it
is
known
today.
he
was
the
first
to
rigorously
examine
how
administrators
made
decisions
when
they
did
not
have
perfect
and
complete
information.
it
was
in
this
area
that
he
was
awarded
the
nobel
prize
in
<year>.at
the
cowles
commission
,
simon
's
main
goal
was
to
link
economic
theory
to
mathematics
and
statistics.
his
main
contributions
were
to
the
fields
of
general
equilibrium
and
econometrics.
he
was
greatly
influenced
by
the
marginalist
debate
that
began
in
the
<year>s.
the
popular
work
of
the
time
argued
that
it
was
not
apparent
empirically
that
entrepreneurs
needed
to
follow
the
marginalist
principles
of
profit-maximization/cost-minimization
in
running
organizations.
the
argument
went
on
to
note
that
profit
maximization
was
not
accomplished
,
in
part
,
because
of
the
lack
of
complete
information.
in
decision-making
,
simon
believed
that
agents
face
uncertainty
about
the
future
and
costs
in
acquiring
information
in
the
present.
these
factors
limit
the
extent
to
which
agents
may
make
a
fully
rational
decision
,
thus
they
possess
only
``
bounded
rationality
''
and
must
make
decisions
by
``
satisficing
''
,
or
choosing
that
which
might
not
be
optimal
,
but
which
will
make
them
happy
enough.
bounded
rationality
is
a
central
theme
in
behavioral
economics.
it
is
concerned
with
the
ways
in
which
the
actual
decision
making
process
influences
decision.
theories
of
bounded
rationality
relax
one
or
more
assumptions
of
standard
expected
utility
theory.
further
,
simon
emphasized
that
psychologists
invoke
a
``
procedural
''
definition
of
rationality
,
whereas
economists
employ
a
``
substantive
''
definition.
gustavos
barros
argued
that
the
procedural
rationality
concept
does
not
have
a
significant
presence
in
the
economics
field
and
has
never
had
nearly
as
much
weight
as
the
concept
of
bounded
rationality.
however
,
in
an
earlier
article
,
bhargava
(
<year>
)
noted
the
importance
of
simon
's
arguments
and
emphasized
that
there
are
several
applications
of
the
``
procedural
''
definition
of
rationality
in
econometric
analyses
of
data
on
health.
in
particular
,
economists
should
employ
``
auxiliary
assumptions
''
that
reflect
the
knowledge
in
the
relevant
biomedical
fields
,
and
guide
the
specification
of
econometric
models
for
health
outcomes.
simon
was
also
known
for
his
research
on
industrial
organization.
he
determined
that
the
internal
organization
of
firms
and
the
external
business
decisions
thereof
,
did
not
conform
to
the
neoclassical
theories
of
``
rational
''
decision-making.
simon
wrote
many
articles
on
the
topic
over
the
course
of
his
life
,
mainly
focusing
on
the
issue
of
decision-making
within
the
behavior
of
what
he
termed
``
bounded
rationality
''
.
``
rational
behavior
,
in
economics
,
means
that
individuals
maximize
their
utility
function
under
the
constraints
they
face
(
e.g.
,
their
budget
constraint
,
limited
choices

)
in
pursuit
of
their
self-interest.
this
is
reflected
in
the
theory
of

utility.
the

he
developed
an
interest

simon
's
main
interests
in
computer
science
were
in
artificial
intelligence
,
human–computer
interaction
,
principles
of
the
organization
of
humans
and
machines
as
information
processing
systems
,
the
use
of
computers
to
study
(
by
modeling
)
philosophical
problems
of
the
nature
of
intelligence
and
of
epistemology
,
and
the
social
implications
of
computer
technology.in
his
youth
,
simon
took
an
interest
in
land
economics
and
georgism
,
an
idea
known
at
the
time
as
``
single
tax
''
.
the
system
is
meant
to
redistribute
unearned
economic
rent
to
the
public
and
improve
land
use.
in
<year>
,
simon
still
maintained
these
ideas
and
argued
that
land
value
tax
should
replace
taxes
on
wages.some
of
simon
's
economic
research
was
directed
toward
understanding
technological
change
in
general
and
the
information
processing
revolution
in
particular.
===
pedagogy
===
simon
's
work
has
strongly
influenced
john
mighton
,
developer
of
a
program
that
has
achieved
significant
success
in
improving
mathematics
performance
among
elementary
and
high
school
students.
mighton
cites
a
<year>
paper
by
simon
and
two
coauthors
that
counters
arguments
by
french
mathematics
educator
,
guy
brousseau
,
and
others
suggesting
that
excessive
practice
hampers
children
's
understanding
:
[
the
]
criticism
of
practice
(
called
``
drill
and
kill
,
''
as
if
this
phrase
constituted
empirical
evaluation
)
is
prominent
in
constructivist
writings.
nothing
flies
more
in
the
face
of
the
last
<integer>
years
of
research
than
the
assertion
that
practice
is
bad.
all
evidence
,
from
the
laboratory
and
from
extensive
case
studies
of
professionals
,
indicates
that
real
competence
only
comes
with
extensive
practice
...
in
denying
the
critical
role
of
practice
one
is
denying
children
the
very
thing
they
need
to
achieve
real
competence.
the
instructional
task
is
not
to
``
kill
''
motivation
by
demanding
drill
,
but
to
find
tasks
that
provide
practice
while
at
the
same
time
sustaining
interest.

the

and
a

leader
of

early
life
and
education
==
stigler
was
born
in
seattle
,
washington
,
the
son
of
elsie
elizabeth
(
hungler
)
and
joseph
stigler.
he
was
of
german
descent
and
spoke
german
in
his
childhood.
he
graduated
from
the
university
of
washington
in
<year>
with
a
ba
and
then
spent
a
year
at
northwestern
university
from
which
he
obtained
his
mba
in
<year>.
it
was
during
his
studies
at
northwestern
that
stigler
developed
an
interest
in
economics
and
decided
on
an
academic
career.
==
career
==
after
he
received
a
tuition
scholarship
from
the
university
of
chicago
,
stigler
enrolled
there
in
<year>
to
study
economics
and
went
on
to
earn
his
ph.d.
in
economics
there
in
<year>.
he
taught
at
iowa
state
college
from
<year>
to
<year>.
he
spent
much
of
world
war
ii
at
columbia
university
,
performing
mathematical
and
statistical
research
for
the
manhattan
project.
he
then
spent
one
year
at
brown
university.
he
served
on
the
columbia
faculty
from
<year>
to
<year>.
at
chicago
,
he
was
greatly
influenced
by
frank
knight
,
his
dissertation
supervisor.
milton
friedman
,
a
friend
for
over
<integer>
years
,
commented
that
it
was
remarkable
for
stigler
to
have
passed
his
dissertation
under
knight
,
as
only
three
or
four
students
had
ever
managed
to
do
so
in
knight
's
<integer>
years
at
chicago.
stigler
's
influences
included
jacob
viner
and
henry
simons
as
well
as
students
w.
allen
wallis
and
friedman.
stigler
is
best
known
for
developing
the
economic
theory
of
regulation
,
also
known
as
capture
,
which
says
that
interest
groups
and
other
political
participants
will
use
the
regulatory
and
coercive
powers
of
government
to
shape
laws
and
regulations
in
a
way
that
is
beneficial
to
them.
this
theory
is
a
component
of
the
public
choice
field
of
economics
but
is
also
deeply
opposed
by
public
choice
scholars
belonging
to
the
``
virginia
school
,
''
such
as
charles
rowley.
he
also
carried
out
extensive
research
in
the
history
of
economic
thought.
stigler
's
most
important
contribution
to
economics
was
published
in
his
landmark
article
,
``
the
economics
of
information.
''
according
to
friedman
,
stigler
``
essentially
created
a
new
area
of
study
for
economists.
''
stigler
stressed
the
importance
of
information
:
``
one
should
hardly
have
to
tell
academicians
that
information
is
a
valuable
resource
:
knowledge
is
power.
and
yet
it
occupies
a
slum
dwelling
in
the
town
of
economics.
''
his
<year>
article
``
information
in
the
labor
market
''
developed
the
theory
of
search
unemployment.
in
<year>
he
was
elected
as
a

nikolaevich
yakovlev
(
russian
:
алекса́ндр
никола́евич
я́ковлев
;
<day>
–
<day>
)
was
a
soviet
and
russian
politician
and
historian.
during
the
<year>s
he
was
a
member
of
the
politburo
and
secretariat
of
the
communist
party
of
the
soviet
union.
he
was
called
the
``
godfather
of
glasnost
''
as
he
is
considered
to
be
the
intellectual
force
behind
mikhail
gorbachev
's
reform
program
of
glasnost
and
perestroika.
yakovlev
was
the
first
soviet
politician
to
acknowledge
the
existence
of
the
secret
protocols
of
the
<year>
ribbentrop-molotov
pact
with
nazi
germany.
==
early
career
==
the
first
child
of
five
,
yakovlev
was
born
to
a
peasant
family
in
a
tiny
village
,
korolevo
,
on
the
volga
river
,
near
yaroslavl.
he
had
four
sisters
,
two
of
whom
died
in
infancy.
his
father
nikolai
alekseevich
only
attended
school
for
four
years
and
his
mother
agafiia
mikhailovna
,
a
nursemaid
,
for
three
months.
yakovlev
was
sickly
in
childhood
and
suffered
from
scrofula.
his
father
served
in
the
red
cavalry
during
the
civil
war
and
was
fully
committed
to
the
communist
regime
;
he
became
the
first
chairman
of
a
local
collective
farm.
their
house
was
set
ablaze
while
he
was
seven
and
the
family
moved
to
krasnye
tkachi.
yakovlev
graduated
from
secondary
school
days
before
nazi
germany
invaded
the
soviet
union.
he
was
drafted
into
the
red
army
in
november
<year>
,
with
brief
training
,
and
was
promoted
to
lieutenant
in
a
rifle
platoon
during
the
war.
he
served
as
a
platoon
commander
in
volkhov
front.
on
august
<integer>
,
<year>
,
he
was
leading
<integer>
chuvash
peasants
and
was
ordered
to
charge
german
positions
in
vinyagolovo
near
leningrad
and
was
badly
wounded.
he
was
hospitalized
until
march
<year>
,
and
almost
required
an
amputation
,
but
was
saved
at
the
last
moment.
he
became
a
member
of
the
communist
party
of
the
soviet
union
in
<year>.
at
this
time
he
regarded
the
communist
party
as
``
life
's
truth
''
and
affirmed
he
was
totally
loyal
and
faithful
to
soviet
union
,
and
he
was
an
ardent
admirer
of
stalin.
in
september
<year>
,
he
resumed
education
at
the
yaroslavl
pedagogical
institute
to
study
history.
on
september
<integer>
,
<year>
,
he
married
nina
ivanovna
smirnova.
he
graduated
the
same
year
and
went
to
moscow
to
attend
the
higher
party
school.
in
november
<year>
,
he
was
appointed
the
instructor
of
the
department
of
propaganda
and
agitation
in
yaroslavl
,
a
post
he
held
for
a
year
and
a
half.
shortly
after
this
,
he
had
his
first
doubts
about
the
regime
,
when
he
was
shocked
to
see
train
after
train
carrying
soviet
ex-prisoners-of-war
being
sent
to
labor
camps.
at
the
vspolye
train
station
,
he
saw
weeping
women
and
was
dismayed
at
how
they
were
treated.
this
memory
troubled
him
deeply
and
never
left
him.
in
march
<year>
,
shortly
after
stalin
's
death
,
he
was
assigned
to
the
party
's
central
committee
as
an
instructor
in
the
department
of
schools.
on
february
<integer>
,
<year>
,
khrushchev
's
secret
speech
became
the
most
traumatic
event
in
yakovlev
's
early
moscow
life
;
he
listened
to
the
speaker
from
the
balcony
in
the
large
kremlin
palace.
after
the
<integer>th
party
congress
,
yakovlev
lost
his
previous
enthusiasm
for
communism
and
led
a
double
life.
he
wanted
to
turn
to
the
original
sources
on
communism—marx
,
engels
,
lenin
,
german
philosophers
,
french
and
italian
socialists
and
british
economists.
he
asked
to
leave
the
central
committee
to
enroll
in
the
academy
of
social
sciences
of
the
central
committee.
while
twice
refused
,
he
was
finally
allowed
to
study
there
for
two
years
and
became
convinced
that
marxism-leninism
was
hollow
,
impractical
,
and
inhumane
,
as
well
as
a
prognostic
fraud.
this
healed
his
internal
political
conflict
following
the
<integer>th
party
congress.
he
began
to
agree
with
khrushchev.beginning
in
<year>
,
he
was
chosen
as
a
fulbright
exchange
student
at
columbia
university
in
the
united
states
for
one
year.
of
the
seventeen
soviet
students
,
fourteen
were
selected
by
the
kgb.
yakovlev
and
three
others
,
all
kgb
personnel
,
including
oleg
kalugin
,
went
to
columbia.
he
studied
intensively
the
english
language
,
roosevelt
and
the
new
deal
,
drawing
connections
between
the
us
at
that
time
and
the
ussr.
at
the
end
,
in
may
<year>
,
the
soviet
visitors
were
taken
on
a
thirty-day
tour
of
the
us
,
during
which
he
stayed
with
us
families
from
vermont
,
chicago
and
iowa.
as
a
result
,
he
began
to
view
perestroika
as
a
ussr-version
of
the
new
deal
to
save
communism
,
as
roosevelt
had
saved
capitalism.
however
,
his
year
in
america
did
little
to
assuage
his
anti-americanism
because
of
the
greed
,
racism
,
and
other
things
that
he
witnessed.
yakovlev
returned
to
the
central
committee
to
work
on
ideology
and
propaganda
,
and
published
several
anti-american
books.
he
defended
a
dissertation
dealing
with
the
historiography
of
us
foreign
policy
,
and
received
the
degree
of
kandidat
nauk
,
the
equivalent
of
a
doctorate
,
in
july
<year>.
in
july
<year>
,
he
was
appointed
the
first
deputy
head
of
the
propaganda
department
of
the
central
committee
of
the
cpsu
by
leonid
brezhnev.
in
august
<year>
,
yakovlev
was
sent
to
prague
as
the
representative
of
cpsu
central
committee
,
and
witnessed
the
entry
of
tanks
into
the
city.
he
later
spoke
out
against
removing
dubcek.
that
same
year
,
he
was
placed
in
command
of
a
group
charged
with
drafting
the
new
constitution.
yakovlev
served
as
editor
of
several
party
publications
and
rose
to
the
key
position
of
head
of
the
cpsu
's
department
of
ideology
and
propaganda
from
<year>
to
<year>.
in
january
<year>
,
he
visited
the
us
again
and
met
ronald
reagan
,
henry
kissinger
,
and
jane
fonda
,
who
warned
him
that
moscow
``
did
not
appreciate
the
full
danger
of
american
militarism
''
.
this
trip
,
again
,
failed
to
change
his
unfavorable
impression
with
us.
in
<year>
,
he
took
a
bold
stand
by
publishing
the
article
entitled
``
against
antihistoricism
''
in
literaturnaya
gazeta
,
critical
of
russian
nationalism
,
and
nationalism
in
the
soviet
union
in
general.
as
a
result
,
he
was
removed
from
his
position.
given
the
choice
of
a
diplomatic
post
as
exile
,
he
chose
to
be
the
ambassador
to
canada
,
remaining
at
that
post
for
a
decade.
he
arrived
in
canada
in
july
<year>.
during
this
time
,
he
and
canadian
prime
minister
pierre
trudeau
became
close
friends.
trudeau
's
second
son
,
alexandre
trudeau
,
was
given
the
russian
nickname
``
sacha
''
after
yakovlev's.from
may
<integer>
to
<integer>
,
<year>
,
yakovlev
accompanied
mikhail
gorbachev
,
who
at
the
time
was
the
soviet
official
in
charge
of
agriculture
,
on
his
tour
of
canada.
the
purpose
of
the
visit
was
to
tour
canadian
farms
and
agricultural
institutions
in
the
hopes
of
taking
lessons
that
could
be
applied
in
the
soviet
union.
however
,
the
two
also
renewed
their
earlier
friendship
and
,
tentatively
at
first
,
began
to
discuss
the
prospect
of
liberalisation
in
the
soviet
union.
in
an
interview
years
later
,
yakovlev
recalled
:
at
first
we
kind
of
sniffed
around
each
other
and
our
conversations
did
n't
touch
on
serious
issues.
and
then
,
verily
,
history
plays
tricks
on
one
,
we
had
a
lot
of
time
together
as
guests
of
then
liberal
minister
of
agriculture
eugene
whelan
in
canada
who
,
himself
,
was
too
late
for
the
reception
because
he
was
stuck
with
some
striking
farmers
somewhere.
so
we
took
a
long
walk
on
that
minister
's
farm
and
,
as
it
often
happens
,
both
of
us
suddenly
were
just
kind
of
flooded
and
let
go.
i
somehow
,
for
some
reason
,
threw
caution
to
the
wind
and
started
telling
him
about
what
i
considered
to
be
utter
stupidities
in
the
area
of
foreign
affairs
,
especially
about
those
ss<integer>
missiles
that
were
being
stationed
in
europe
and
a
lot
of
other
things.
and
he
did
the
same
thing.
we
were
completely
frank.
he
frankly
talked
about
the
problems
in
the
internal
situation
in
russia.
he
was
saying
that
under
these
conditions
,
the
conditions
of
dictatorship
and
absence
of
freedom
,
the
country
would
simply
perish.
so
it
was
at
that
time
,
during
our
three-hour
conversation
,
almost
as
if
our
heads
were
knocked
together
,
that
we
poured
it
all
out
and
during
that
three-hour
conversation
we
actually
came
to
agreement
on
all
our
main
points.
two
weeks
after
the
visit
,
as
a
result
of
gorbachev
's
interventions
,
yakovlev
was
recalled
from
canada
by
yuri
andropov
and
became
director
of
the
institute
of
world
economy
and
international
relations
of
the
ussr
academy
of
sciences
in
moscow
on
august
<integer>
,
<year>
;
he
was
succeeded
by
his
friend
yevgeny
primakov
in
<year>.
although
he
was
impressed
with
canada
's
free
,
competitive
economy—especially
in
agriculture
,
the
weakest
part
for
the
ussr—and
the
benefits
of
rule
of
law
,
yakovlev
published
a
booklet
called
poor
santa
claus
,
or
the
police
eye
of
democracy
allegedly
exposing
canadian
totalitarian
practices
under
the
pseudonym
n.
agashin.
it
described
how
capitalism
created
``
its
sanitary
serve
-
a
system
of
repression
,
intimidation
and
terror
''
,
how
it
``
brainwashed
its
citizens
''
,
how
the
united
states
``
tyrannized
its
neighbor
''
,
and
that
canada
was
really
a
totalitarian
police
state
with
a
democratic
façade.
==
perestroika
and
its
aftermath
==
when
gorbachev
became
general
secretary
of
the
communist
party
of
the
soviet
union
in
<year>
,
yakovlev
became
a
senior
advisor
,
helping
to
shape
soviet
foreign
policy
by
advocating
soviet
non-intervention
in
eastern
europe
,
and
accompanying
gorbachev
on
his
five
summit
meetings
with
president
of
the
united
states
ronald
reagan.
in
the
summer
of
<year>
,
yakovlev
became
head
of
the
propaganda
department
of
the
cpsu
central
committee.
domestically
,
he
argued
in
favor
of
the
reform
programs
that
became
known
as
glasnost
(
openness
)
and
perestroika
(
restructuring
)
and
played
a
key
role
in
executing
those
policies.
after
the
xx
congress
,
in
an
ultra-narrow
circle
of
our
closest
friends
and
associates
,
we
often
discussed
the
problems
of
democratization
of
the
country
and
society.
we
chose
a
simple
-
like
a
sledgehammer
-
method
of
propagating
the
``
ideas
''
of
late
lenin.
a
group
of
true
,
not
imaginary
reformers
developed
(
of
course
,
orally
)
the
following
plan
:
to
strike
with
the
authority
of
lenin
at
stalin
,
at
stalinism.
and
then
,
if
successful
,
-
to
strike
with
plekhanov
and
social
democracy
-
at
lenin
,
and
then
–
with
liberalism
and
``
moral
socialism
''
-
at
revolutionarism
in
general
...
the
soviet
totalitarian
regime
could
be
destroyed
only
through
glasnost
and
totalitarian
party
discipline
,
while
hiding
behind
the
interests
of
improving
socialism.
[
...
]
looking
back
,
i
can
proudly
say
that
a
clever
,
but
very
simple
tactic
-
the
mechanisms
of
totalitarianism
against
the
system
of
totalitarianism
–
has
worked.
in
<year>
,
the
russian
nationalist
organization
pamyat
sent
a
letter
entitled
``
stop
yakovlev
!
''
to
the
plenum
of
the
central
committee
of
the
communist
party
of
the
soviet
union
,
labelling
yakovlev
as
the
main
instigator
of
a
course
of
action
that
would
lead
to
the
'capitulation
before
the
imperialists'.for
decades
,
it
was
the
official
policy
of
the
soviet
union
to
deny
the
existence
of
the
secret
protocol
to
the
nazi–soviet
pact.
at
the
behest
of
mikhail
gorbachev
,
yakovlev
headed
a
commission
investigating
the
existence
of
such
a
protocol.
in
december
<year>
yakovlev
concluded
that
the
protocol
had
existed
and
revealed
his
findings
to
the
soviet
parliament.
as
a
result
,
the
first
multi-party
elected
congress
of
soviets
since
<year>
``
passed
the
declaration
admitting
the
existence
of
the
secret
protocols
,
condemning
and
denouncing
them
''
.he
was
promoted
to
the
politburo
in
<year>
,
but
by
<year>
he
had
become
the
focus
of
attacks
by
hardliner
communists
in
the
party
opposed
to
liberalization.
at
the
<integer>th
congress
of
the
communist
party
of
the
soviet
union
in
july
<year>
,
a
cynical
alexander
lebed
caused
uproar
when
he
asked
yakovlev
:
``
alexander
nikolaevich
...
how
many
faces
have
you
got
?
''
an
embarrassed
yakovlev
consulted
his
colleagues
and
continued
on
with
the
proceedings
,
but
resigned
from
the
politburo
the
day
after
the
congress
concluded.
as
the
communists
opposed
to
liberalization
gained
strength
,
his
position
became
more
tenuous
;
fiercely
attacked
by
his
former
protégé
gennady
zyuganov
in
may
<year>
,
he
resigned
from
the
party
two
days
before
the
august
coup
in
<year>.
during
the
coup
,
yakovlev
joined
the
democratic
opposition
against
it.
following
the
failed
coup
attempt
,
yakovlev
blamed
gorbachev
for
having
been
naïve
in
bringing
the
plotters
into
his
inner
circle
,
saying
gorbachev
was
``
guilty
of
forming
a
team
of
traitors.
why
did
he
surround
himself
with
people
capable
of
treason
?
''
in
his
book
inside
the
stalin
archives
(
<year>
)
,
jonathan
brent
relates
that
in
<year>
,
when
there
were
lithuanian
crowds
demonstrating
for
independence
from
the
soviet
union
,
gorbachev
consulted
yakovlev
about
the
wisdom
of
an
armed
repression
against
them.
gorbachev
asked
,
``
should
we
shoot
?
''
yakovlev
answered
that
,
``
if
a
single
soviet
soldier
fired
a
single
bullet
on
the
unarmed
crowds
,
soviet
power
would
be
over.
''
soviet
troops
did
intervene
militarily
in
an
attempt
to
suppress
the
demonstrations
,
and
the
ussr
collapsed
seven
months
later.yakovlev
led
boris
yeltsin
's
commission
for
the
rehabilitation
of
victims
of
soviet
political
repression.in
the
years
following
the
dissolution
of
the
soviet
union
,
yakovlev
wrote
and
lectured
extensively
on
history
,
politics
and
economics.
he
acted
as
the
leader
of
the
russian
party
of
social
democracy
,
which
in
the
mid-<year>s
fused
into
the
united
democrats
(
a
pro-reform
alliance
that
was
later
reorganized
into
the
union
of
right

)
.
in
<year>
,
acting
as
head
of
the
presidential
committee
for
the
rehabilitation
of

,
he
was
present
at
the
announcement

of
the
victims
of

purges.
in

later
life
,
he
founded
and
led
the
international
democracy
foundation.
he
advocated
taking
responsibility
for
the
past
crimes
of
communism
and
was
critical
of
president
vladimir

's
restrictions
on

in

he
publicly
alleged

who
became
famous
for
his

where
his
family
owned
a
pear
orchard.
devoted
presbyterian
missionaries
,
his
parents
moved
to
the
philippines
when
dunlop
was
four
years
old
,
the
eldest
of
a
family
that
grew
to
seven
children.
he
was
raised
and
educated
on
the
island
of
cebu
,
and
remained
there
until
graduating
from
high
school.
then
,
dunlop
returned
to
the
united
states
with
his
older
brother
to
enroll
in
college.
dunlop
was
initially
rejected
from
the
university
of
california
,
berkeley
because
of
his
unusual
background
and
instead
enrolled
at
marin
junior
college
in
<year>.
dunlop
later
transferred
to
the
university
of
california
,
berkeley
,
where
he
graduated
summa
cum

in
<year>.
he
remained
there
for
his
doctorate
in
economics
,
where
he
produced
the
dissertation
``
movements
of
wage-rates
in
the
business
cycle
''
(
<year>
)
.
while
studying
at
berkeley
,
dunlop
met
with
his
wife
,
dorothy
emily
webb
;
they
married
on
july
<integer>
,
<year>.
that
year
,
dunlop
went
to
cambridge
university
on
a
fellowship
in
order
to
study
under
john
maynard
keynes.
at
the
time
,
dunlop
lived
near
john
kenneth
galbraith
,
who
later
became
a
colleague
at
harvard.although
dunlop
's
intention
was
to
study
with
keynes
during
the
fellowship
,
the
elder
's
poor
health
limited
their
interaction.
nonetheless
,
dunlop
's
study
of
wage
setting
in
the
cotton
mill
industry
based
on
fieldwork
conducted
during
that
visit
led
him
to
publish
a
major
paper
in
the
economic

a
problem
in

===
professorial
career
===
dunlop
was
shortly
after
offered
a
teaching
fellowship
at
harvard
university
's
economics
department
that
he
maintained
throughout
the
rest
of
his
life.
he
was
tenured
in
<year>
and
became
a
full
professor
at
harvard
in
<year>.
he
later
chaired
the
department
of
economics
between
<year>
and
<year>
,
and
was
dean
of
the
faculty
of
arts
and
sciences
between
<year>
and
<year>.
dunlop
was
named
lamont
university
professor
in
<year>.
dunlop
focused
on
wage
determination
and
the
role
of
markets
and
institutions
in
their
determination.
he
wrote
a
series
of
articles
in
economic
journals
regarding
the
role
of
unions
in
wage
setting
,
arguing
that
unions
focused
on
balancing
wage
gains
in
collective
bargaining
against
their
employment
effects.
he
also
explored
the
impact
of
product
market
forces
on
the
level
of
wages
,
arguing
that
neoclassical
models
of
wage
determination
underplayed
the
important
(
and
sometimes
idiosyncratic
)
role
of
product
markets.
in
<year>
,
he
brought
together
his
scholarly
work
on
wage
determination
with
applied
experience
in
dispute
resolution
in
his
seminal
book
industrial
relations
systems.
the
book
proposed
a
model
of
how
an
``
industrial
relations
system
''
brings
together
product
market
,
regulatory
,
and
technological
factors
with
the
institutional
practices
of
labor
and
business
to
produce
wages
,
benefits
,
and
other
workplace
outcomes.
several
decades
of
scholarly
debate
followed
its
publication.
he
subsequently
collaborated
with

leading
a

faculty
committee
through

of
organizing

,
a
new

was
elected
at

in

tapped
dunlop
to

thwarted
action
on
many
of
the

commission
's
recommendations.
dunlop
nonetheless
went
on
to
work
on
promoting
negotiated
rulemaking
for
workplace
health
and
safety
and
crafted
an
agreement
between
the
occupational
safety
and
health
administration
,
the
national

===
dispute
resolution
in
multiple
fields
===
along
with
his
service
in
government
,
dunlop
practiced
dispute
resolution
in
a
variety
of
other
areas
,
pioneering
innovative
multi-party
agreements
in
a
variety
of
areas.
in
agriculture
,
he
intervened
in
an
eight-year-old
dispute
between
the
campbell
soup
company
,
the
farm
labor
organizing
committee
(
floc
,
an
afl-cio
affiliate
that
organized
farm
workers
in
the
midwest
)
and
tomato
growers
in
michigan
and
ohio
regarding
conditions
of
work
among
the
migrant
workers
who
worked
for
growers
supplying
campbell
's
with
tomatoes.
since
agricultural
workers
are
exempted
from
the
nlra
,
private
sector
employers
are
not
obligated
to
recognize
unions.
in
addition
,
the
farm
workers
were
treated
as
independent
contractors
to
the
individual
growers
supplying
campbell
soup.
growers
contended
that
the
prices
received
for
their
tomatoes
precluded
increases
in
wages
or
provision
of
better
housing
conditions
in
labor
camps.
in
<year>
,
campbell
soup
approached
dunlop
to
assist
them
in
settling
the
dispute.
dunlop
brought
together
the
parties
and
fashioned
an
agreement
ending
the
corporate
campaign
in
exchange
for
union
representation
among
tomato
growers
,
including
a
mechanism
for
union
recognition
and
dispute
resolution
through
a
commission
chaired
by
dunlop
and
an
equal
number
of
representatives
of
labor
and
growers.
the
agreement
also
provided
growers
higher
prices
in
exchange
for
agreement
to
bargaining
with
the
union.
as
a
result
,
the
agreement
created
a
private
system
of
union
recognition
,
collective
bargaining
and
dispute
resolution
accepted
by
the
parties.
the
agreement
soon
expanded
to
include
pickle
growers
and
the
food
processors
vlasic
and
dean
foods
and
has
been
renewed
consistently
to
the
present.
in
<year>
,
an
agreement
between
floc
and
the
north
carolina
growers
association
extending
the
dunlop
agricultural
commission
model
was
signed

only

to
undertake
a

(

later
the

)
of

eventually
dunlop

and

efforts
led
to
the
creation
of

a
final
area
of
innovative
dispute
resolution
arose
in
dunlop
's
home
state
of
massachusetts.
following
a
growing
number
of
disputes
and
walkouts
among

in

dunlop
mediated
an

,
an
association

,
and

on
legislation
to

body
to
handle

problems
in

the
legislation
was
passed
in

creating
the
joint

committee
(
jlmc
)
.
the
vast
majority
of
the
more
than
<integer>
disputes
handled
by
the
jlmc
in
its
history
were
done
through
mediation
rather
than
the

which
imposed
a
settlement
on
the
municipal
executive
where
the

occurred
(
but
not
on

,
such
as

.

commented
that

his
insistence
on

he
helped
establish
both
a
theoretical
and
a
practical
method
of
resolving
problems
and
creating
institutions
for
their
ongoing
evolution.
in
his
introduction
to

adiseshiah
said

unesco
has

it

there
has
been

that
adiseshiah
refused

he
said
that
a
central
cabinet
minister
asked
adiseshiah’s
consent
for
appointment
as
governor
of
goa.
adiseshiah
immediately
refused
the
offer
stating
that
he
was
not
willing
to
accept
any
task
which
would
cause
his
long
separation
from

the
central

minister
,
after
consulting
with
the
then
prime
minister

,
offered
adiseshiah
the
governorship
of

knowing
full
well
that
it
was
against
the
prevailing
convention
that
no

born

adiseshiah
was

up
his
mind.
next

during

constitutional

he
asked
nedunchezhian
,
who
was
his
walk
companion
for
many
years
,
for
his
opinion
about
the
offer.
nedunchezhian
replied
that
adiseshiah
was
always
a
man
of
action
and
that
the
governor
of
a
state
was
more
a
ceremonial
post
which
would
only
put
fetters
around
his
multi-pronged
activities.
later
in

day
,
adiseshiah
conveyed
to
the
central
cabinet
minister
that
he
was
not
accepting
the
offer
of
the
governorship
of

nedunchezhian
also
recalled
that
it

consulted
him
about

‘political’
decision

two
decades

<end_of_passage><start_of_passage>henri
laborit
(
<day>
–
<day>
)
was
a
french
surgeon
,
neurobiologist
,
writer
and
philosopher.
in
<year>
,
laborit
was
instrumental
in
the
development
of
the
drug
chlorpromazine
,
published
his
findings
,
and
convinced
three
psychiatrists
to
test
it
on
a
patient
,
resulting
in
great
success.
laborit
was
recognized
for
his
work
,
but
as
a
surgeon
searching
for
an
anesthetic
,
he
became
at
odds
with
psychiatrists
who
made
their
own
discoveries
and
competing
claims.
laborit
wrote
several
books
where
he
vulgarizes
his
ethological
laboratory
research
and
marries
it
,
through
systems
thinking
,
with
knowledge
from
several
other
disciplines
,
being
a
strong
advocate
of
interdisciplinarity
and
transdisciplinarity.
his
writings
can
also
be
found
to
have
deep
roots
in
anarchist
thought.
he
was
personally
untroubled
by
the
requirements
of
science
and
the
constraints
of
university
life.
he
maintained
an
independence
from
academia
and
never
sought
to
produce
the
orderly
results
that
science
requires
of
its
adherents.
==
family
and
early
years
==
henri
laborit
was
born
in
hanoi
,
french
indochina
,
in
<year>.
his
father
was
a
physician
and
colonial
officer
who
died
in
<year>
from
tetanus.
laborit
contracted
tuberculosis
at
age
<integer>.
in
paris
,
he
earned
a
baccalaureate.
he
spent
two
years
in
indochina
on
a
hospital
ship.
he
passed
the
examinations
at
the
naval
health
service
in
bordeaux
,
and
became
a
navy
physician.
he
was
sent
to
sidi
abdallah
bizerte.
feeling
that
his
options
for
recognition
would
be
better
,
he
switched
to
become
a
surgeon.
during
world
war
ii
he
was
stationed
on
the
torpedo
boat
sirocco
,
where
he
witnessed
the
evacuation
of
the
dunkerque
,
and
then
was
sunk
by
the
germans.
he
was
saved
by
an
english
sloop
that
picked
him
up.
he
received
the
french
military
cross
with
distinction.
he
was
later
stationed
in
dakar.
by
about
<year>
he
was
appointed
to
val-de-grâce
hospital
in
paris.
==
chlorpromazine
==
laborit
was
the
first
to
recognize
the
potential
psychiatric
uses
of
chlorpromazine.
the
science
of
anesthesiology
was
new
since
the
<year>s.
surgeons
were
sometimes
responsible
for
anesthetics
and
as
a
french
navy
surgeon
,
laborit
had
seen
patients
die
as
a
result
of
or
after
their
operations.
he
became
a
researcher
in
anesthesiology.
laborit
's
ideas
on
anesthesia
included
potentiated
anaesthesia
,
lowering
basal
metabolism
and
lowering
body
temperature
(
so-called
artificial
hibernation
)
.
he
advocated
the
use
of
procaine
,
synthetic
antihistamines
,
diparcol
(
diethazine
)
,
tetraethylammonium
bromide
and
vitamin
b1.
he
did
not
like
to
use
morphine.
in
his
years
in
bizerte
he
became
interested
in
the
use
of
the
antihistamine
promethazine
to
make
patients
more
relaxed
before
surgery
and
in
contributing
to
anesthesia
,
observations
that
were
the
forerunner
of
his
later
interest
in
chlorpromazine.
with
pierre
huguenard
,
laborit
invented
the
lytic
cocktail
,
a
combination
of
drugs
that
could
be
given
to
patients
to
reduce
the
shock
and
stress
they
experienced
during
and
after
surgery.
huguenard
had
success
with
a
combination
of
promethazine
and
pethidine
,
at
the
time
under
the
trade
names
diparcol
and
dolossal
,
and
told
laborit
of
his
finding.
laborit
thought
that
putting
patients
into
a
state
of
artificial
hibernation
would
prevent
some
aspects
of
stress
reactions.
these
drugs
made
bodies
stop
their
reactions
to
cooling.
laborit
suggested
to
rhône-poulenc
(
a
pharmaceutical
company
that
became
sanofi
)
that
they
create
antihistamines
that
optimized
stabilization
of
the
central
nervous
system.
there
,
chemist
paul
charpentier
headed
a
group
trying
to
improve
on
the
existing
drug
diphenhydramine
(
benadryl
,
dramamine
,
sominex
)
.
so
charpentier
created
a
new
series
of
phenothiazines
,
one
of
them
by
adding
a
chlorine
atom.
simone
courvoisier
tested
the
series
on
laboratory
rats
and
discovered
that
rp
<integer>
(
chlorinated
promazine
,
later
known
as
chlorpromazine
)
could
reverse
the
effects
of
epinephrine
and
could
induce
a
state
of
apathy
or
indifference.
rhône-poulenc
marketed
the
drug
in
europe
for
vomiting
,
pain
,
nausea
,
and
convulsions
as
largactil
in
<year>.
laborit
is
said
to
have
named
the
drug
,
a
blended
word
for
``
large
activity
''
.he
,
huguenard
and
an
associate
named
r.
alluaume
published
``

''
in

according
to
max

,
``

boal
adapted
these
methods
to
social
conditions
in
brazil
,
taking
a
leftist
approach
on
issues
concerning
nationalism
,
which
were
very
much
in

===
while
working
at
the
arena
theatre
in
são
paulo
,
boal
directed
a
number
of
classical
dramas
,
which
he
transformed
to
make
them
more
pertinent
to
brazilian
society
and
its
economy.
among
these
plays
was
john
steinbeck
's
of
mice
and
men
,
known
in
brazil
as
ratos
e
homens.
this
was
boal
's
first
performance
as
a
director
at
the
arena
theatre
of
são
paulo.
critics
acclaimed
this
piece
and
boal
won
the
prêmio
de
revelação
de
direção
(
direction
revelation
award
)
from
the
association
of
art
critics
of
são
paulo
,
in
<year>.
in
the
early
sixties
,
the
ratings
at
the
arena
theatre
of
são
paulo
started
to
drop
,
almost
causing
the
theatre
to
go
bankrupt.
consequently
,
the
company
decided
to
start
investing
in
national
theatre
(
pieces
written
by
brazilian
dramaturgs
)
as
a
move
that
could
possibly
save
it
from
bankruptcy.
the
new
investment
proved
to
be
a
success
,
opening
up
the
path
for
a
national
theatre
scene.
boal
then
suggested
the
creation
of
a
seminar
in
dramaturgy
at
the
arena
theatre
,
which
was
quickly
implemented
and
soon
became
a
national
platform
for
many
young
playwrights.
many
successful
productions
were
born
from
this
seminar
and
now
form
part
of
the
arena
theatre
of
são
paulo
's
nationalist
phase
repertoire.
one
of
these
productions
was
chapetuba

by

directed
by

exile
===
a
new
military
regime
started
in
brazil
in
<year>
with
a
coup
d'état
supported
by
the
brazilian
elite
,
the
industrialists
,
the
military
,
as
well
as
by
the
united
states
,
boal
's
teachings
were
controversial
,
and
as
a
cultural
activist
he
was
seen
as
a
threat
by
the
brazilian
military
regime.
in
<year>
,
boal
was
kidnapped
off
the
street
,
arrested
,
tortured
,
and
eventually
exiled
to
argentina
,
where
he
stayed
for
five
years.
during
those
five
years
,
boal
published
two
books
:
torquemada
(
<year>
)
and
his
much
acclaimed
theatre
of
the
oppressed
(
<year>
)
.
torquemada
is
about
the
brazilian
military
regime
's
systematic
use
of
torture
in
prison.
boal
takes
the
name
of
the
leading
figure
of
the
spanish
inquisition
,
tomas
de
torquemada
,
as
an
example
of
historical
forms
of
systematic
torture.
in
theatre
of
the
oppressed
boal
develops
a
theatrical
method
based
on
pedagogy
of
the
oppressed
,
a
book
by
the
brazilian
educator
and
writer
paulo
freire
(
who
was
also
a
good
friend
of
boal
)
.boal
's
method
(
which
has
been
implemented
in
various
communities
around
the
world
)
seeks
to
transform
audiences
into
active
participants
in
the
theatrical
experience.
boal
argues
that
traditional
theatre
is
oppressive
since
spectators
usually
do
not
get
a
chance
to
express
themselves
and
that
a
collaboration
between
both
parties
,
in
contrast
,
allows
spectators
to
perform
actions
that
are
socially
liberating.
the
method
,
as
boal
liked
to
explain
,
seeks
to
transform
spectators
into
``
spect-actors.
''
when
the
political
climate
in
brazil
forced
boal
into
exile
in
<year>
,
he
initially
went
to
peru
and
then
argentina
,
where
he
completed
and
published
his
seminal
theoretical
work
the
theatre
of
the
oppressed
and
consolidated
his
conscientização
(
consciousness-raising
)
theatre
work
based
on
the
idea
of
brazilian
educationalist
paulo
freire.
freire
's
methods
were
a
revolt
against
the
elitist
``
top-down
''
approach
to
education
and
he
advocated
critical-awareness-based
education
models.
boal
's
work
in
peru
with
the
alfin
project
,
a
movement
which
sought
to
use
a
range
of
languages
including
``
artistic
languages
''
to
eradicate
illiteracy
,
developed
his
ideas
and
methodology
away
from
the
agit-prop
of
his
brazilian
arena
theatre
days
and
sought
to
engage
theatre
as
a
pedagogical
tool.
crucial
to
this
time
was
boal
's
attempts
to
break
down
the
divisions
between
spectator
and
actor.
it
is
around
this
time
that
invented
the
term
``
spect-actor
''
,
a
term
that
he
saw
as
establishing
the
frameworks
within
which
he
wished
to
work.
he
saw
that
the
passivity
of
the
spectator
could
be
broken
down
by
the
following
steps
by
which
the
spectator
becomes
the
spect-actor
:
knowing
the
body
(
by
body
he
means
both
the
individual
``
body
''
and
the
collective
``
body
''
in
a
marxist
sense
)
making
the
body
expressive
using
theatre
as
a
language
using
theatre
as
discourseafter
living
in
argentina
,
boal
travelled
to
other
countries
in
south
america
such
as
peru
and
ecuador
,
where
he
worked
with
people
in
small
and
usually
poor
communities
that
dealt
with
conflicts
such
as
civil
wars
and
lack
of
government
attention.
boal
was
of
the
opinion
that
only
the
oppressed
are
able
to
free
the
oppressed.
in
peru
,
boal
practiced
his
forum
theatre
method
,
in
which
spectator
replaces
actor
to
determine
the
solution
to
a
given
problem
presented
by
the
actor
,
which
can
also
be
a
real
problem
someone
in
the
community
is
facing.
boal
also
lived
in
paris
,
france
,
for
a
number
of
years
,
where
he
created
several
centers
for
the
theatre
of
the
oppressed
,
directed
plays
,
and
also
taught
classes
at
the
sorbonne
university.
boal
created
the
first
international
festival
for
the
theatre
of
the
oppressed
in
<year>.while
boal
was
in
exile
,
his
very
close
friend
and
brazilian
musician
chico
buarque
wrote
him
a
letter
that
would
later
result
in
the
chorinho
hit
called
``
meu
caro
amigo
''
or
``
my
dear
friend
''
(
<year>
)
.
in
this
song
,
buarque
tells
his
friend
about
the
situation
in
brazil
at
the
time
,
addressing
the
military
dictatorship
in
a
very
subtle
but
clever
way
(
due
to
censorship
issues
,
many
artists
could
not
express
themselves
freely
)
.
the
melody
of
the
song
is
very
happy
and
upbeat
while
the
lyrics
explain
:
my
dear
friend
,
please
forgive
me
,

i
can’t
pay

boal
returned
to
brazil
after

in

boal
's
group
has
worked
next
to
numerous
organizations
that
fight
for

in
<year>
,
boal
ran
for
city
councillor
in
rio
de

as
a
theatrical
act
,
and
he
was
elected.
boal
's
support
staff
was
his
theatre
group
,
with
whom
he
quickly
developed
various
legislative
proposals.
his
objective
was
to
work
out
issues
citizens

be
facing
in
their
communities
through
theatre
and
also
to
discuss
the
laws
of
the

after
having
worked
to
transform
spectator
into

in
theatre
of
the

,
boal
initiates
the
legislative
theatre

in

boal
is
known
to
say
that
he
did
not
create

arbitrarily
while
he
was

he
asked

got
approved
even
after
boal
had
left.
boal
also
worked
with
prisoners
in

boal
argued
that
people
in
prison
are
not
free
in

but
that
they
are
in

and
that
the
theatre

that

imagine

invent

influences
==
most
of
augusto
boal
's
techniques
were
created
after
he
realized
the
limitations
of
didactic
,
politically
motivated
theatre
in
the
poor
areas
where
he
worked.
he
found
that
his
attempts
to
inspire
the
people
living
in
poor
or
``
slum
''
areas
to
rise
up
against
racial
and
class
inequality
were
inhibited
by
his
own

he
was
white
and
comparatively
financially
comfortable
,
as
well
as
his
and
his

his
new
techniques
allowed
the
idea
of
rebellion
and
the
impetus
for
change
to
come
from
within
the
target
group.
much
of
his
early
work
and
teaching
was
inspired
by
marxist

,
although
much
of

now
falls
within

paulo

argues

)
===
arguably
augusto
boal
's
most
academically
influential
work
is
the
theatre
of
the
oppressed
,
in
which
the
reader
follows
boal
's
detailed
analysis
of
the
poetics
of
aristotle
and
the
early
history
of
western
theatre.
boal
contends
that
the
aristotelian
ethic
means
oppressing
the
masses
,
the
people
,
the
workers
and
the
spectators
in
favour
of
stability
and
the
continued
dominance
of
a
privileged
few.
he
argues
that
the
tragi-drama
,
a
formulaic
drama
style
that
today
could
be
considered
similar
to
that
of
soap
operas
,
helps
the
state
promote
its
continued
existence.
he
sees
the
brazilian
government
as
an
example
of
an
oppressive
state
using
theatre
to
propagate
its
oppressive
system.

then
outlines
his
early
theories

practices

to
reverse

over

boal
also
talks
about
invisible
theatre
in
which
an
event
is
planned
and
scripted
but
does
not
allow
the
spectators
to
know
that
the
event
is
happening.
actors
perform
out
of
the
ordinary
roles
which
invite
spectators
to
join
in
or
sit
back
and
watch.
one
example
was
in
a
restaurant
at
the
chiclayo
hotel
,
actors
sat
at
separate
tables
and
informed
the
waiters
in
loud
voices
that
they
could
not
eat
the
food.
the
actor
stated
that
the
food
was
not
good.
the
waiter
says
the
diner
could
pick
something
else
to
eat.
so
the
actor
chose
a
rather
expensive
item
off
the
menu
and
says
he
will
be
able
to
pay
for
it.
the
actor
mentions
he
has
no
money
and
he
would
be
willing
to
work
for
it.
this
display
made
other
diners
start
discussing
the
price
and
treatment
of
workers
at
this
hotel.
this
act
allowed
spectators
to
think
about
issues
that
were
going
on
but
was
brushed
over
because
the
issue
did
not
directly
involve
them.
analytical
theatre
is
when
a
participant
tells
a
story
and
the
actors
improvise
it.
each
character
is
broken
down
into
all
the
social
roles
they
could
follow
and
the
participants
choose
an
object
to
symbolize
the
role.
this
aspect
of
theatre
allows
the
participants
to
see
how
there
are
multiple
roles
a
person
could
follow.

boal

through
his
work
at
french
institutions
for
the
mentally
ill
and
elsewhere
in
europe
,
where
he
discovered
concepts
such
as
the
``
cop
in
the
head
''
,
the
theories
presented
in
this
book
have
been
useful
in
the
pioneering
field
of
drama
therapy
and
have
been
applied
by
drama
practitioners.
boal
states
in
his
work
that
there
are
three
properties
of
the
aesthetic
space.
first
,
is
plasticity.
he
says
that
one
can
be
without
being.
objects
can
acquire
different
meaning
such
as
an
old
chair
representing
a
king
's
throne.
he
states
that
only
duration
counts
and
location
can
be
changed.
second
,
is
that
the
aesthetic
space
is
dichotomic
and
it
creates
dichotomy.
this
idea
suggests
that
there
is
a
space
within
a
space.
the
stage
is
in
front
of
the
audience
and
the
actor
is
creating
his
own
space.
third
,
is
telemicroscopic.
this
idea
creates
the
idea
that
it
is
impossible
to
hide
on
stage.
every
aspect
of
the
space
is
seen
and
it
makes
the
far
away
close-up.

,
which
is
very
well
known
in

activity
analysis
,
the
study
of
interactions
between
the
inputs

of
production
,
and
their
relationship
to
economic

a.i.
kitov
was
the
first
one
to
demonstrate
necessity
of
creation
of
national
automated
system
for
management
in
the
state
economy
and
–
simultaneously
–
in
the
armed
forces
,
on
basis
of
full-scale
usage
of

methods.
clear
understanding
of
the
ams
development
importance
led
kitov
,
at
the
end
of

,
to
the
conclusion
about
necessity
of
automatisation
of
management
of
the
national
economy
and
also
of
its
armed
forces.
the
main
point
was
,
that
this
automated
management
system
should
be
based
on
national
network
of
regional
computer
centres
(
project
``
red

''
)
.
a.i.
kitov
is
famous
for
being
the
first
one
in
the
world
who
suggested
project
of
an
global
integrated
computer
network
for
automated
management
of
both
the
ussr
national
economy
and
the
armed
forces
,
functioning
of
which
would
be
based
on
computers
and
mathematical
methods.
he
proposed
that
technological
structure
of
that
system
would
be
a
global
,
double
purpose
,
computer
network
,
covering
the
whole
ussr
territory.
this
network
should
consist
of
hundreds
of
computer
centres
maintained
by
specially
qualified
military

in

a.i.
kitov
sent
his

)
to
the
leader
of

===
information
retrieval
systems
===
typical
example
of
kitov’s
scientific
intuition
consisted
in
his
opinion
on
information
retrieval
systems.
he
aimed
efforts
of
his
cc
№<integer>
scientists
at
their
development.
creation
of
information

became
really
``
pioneer
direction
''
not
only
for
the
ussr
armed
forces
but
for
the
whole
soviet
it
as
well.
anatoly
kitov
initiated
scientific
works
at
the
cc
№<integer>
on
the
mathematical
linguistics
and
machine
translation.
kitov
proposed
to
concentrate
basic
efforts
not
on
direct
increasing
of
performance
,
but
first
on
development
of
methods
,
algorithms
and

which
permitted

theory
and

of
algorithmic

===
a.
kitov
is
the
creator
of
two
algorithmic
programming
languages
-
algem
and
normin.
compared
with
algol<integer>
,
algem
was
completed
with

data
,
which
made
possible
processing
of
not
only
numerical
but
also
text-based
information
and
data
groups
of
various
types.
during
a
long
time
algem
was
a
``
working
horse
''
for
the
soviet
programmers
,
who
were
working
in
the
field
``
non-arithmetical

applications
of

,
it
was
also
used
in
numerous
ams
of
various
levels
implemented
in
industry
and
administrative
management
structures
,
both
in
the
ussr
and
in
the
socialist
countries.
in
the
<year>-s
while
working
as
the
chief-designer
of
the
ams
‘healthcare’
,
a.i.
kitov
developed
algorithmic
programming
language
normin
,
which
was
widely
used
in
the
ussr
for
programming
medical
problems.
that
was
the
first
,
in
the
ussr
,
query
language
for
the
information
retrieval
on
formalised
natural
language.
taking
under
consideration
that
medical
ams
would
be
used
by
the
people
,
who
didn’t
have
special
technical
education
kitov
implemented
special
interface
in
his
systems
,
which
was
convenient
and
easily
understandable
on
intuition
level
as
much
as
it
was
possible
at
the
level
of
computer
development
of
that
time.

already
in
his
letter
to

khrushchev
,
from
<decimal>.<year>
,
kitov
insisted
that
introduction
of
automated
systems
in

should
be
conducted
under
supervision
of
the
state
administrator
of
high
level
–
such
as
the
member
of
the
political-bureau
of
the
central
committee
of
the
communist
party.
the
whole
work
in
the
field
of

and
automated
management
systems
should
be
subjected
to
a
single
body
of
the

–special

which
would
be
granted
the
monopoly
to
coordinate

``

.
in
his
article

a.i.
kitov
declares
,
that

relations
with
the
ussr
====
his
foreign
policy
was
marked
by
efforts
to
bring
mongolia
into
ever-closer
cooperation
with
the
ussr.
still
,
tsedenbal
and
his
group
of
party
leaders
(
such
as
tsagaan-lamyn
dugersuren
and
damdinjavyn
maidar
)
were
dissatisfied
with
the
economic
role
that
the
soviet
leadership
assigned
to
mongolia.
while
the
ussr
prodded
the
mongolian
government
to
concentrate
its
efforts
on
the
development
of
agriculture
and
the
mineral
sector
,
tsedenbal
and
his
followers
sought
to
foster
rapid
industrialization
even
in
the
face
of
soviet
opposition.
at
the
same
time
,
tsedenbal
was
cautious
enough
to
frequently
express
his
loyalty
to
the
kremlin
and
portray
his
intra-party
critics—including
daramyn
tömör-ochir
,
tsogt-ochiryn
loohuuz
,
and
others—as
``
pro-chinese
factionalists
''
and
``
nationalists.
''
with
the
full
backing
of
the
soviets
,
tsedenbal
successfully
purged
his
political
opponents.
during
his
reign
as
head
of
the
state
,
tsedenbal
submitted
requests
for
the
incorporation
of
mongolia
into
the
ussr
on
five
to
eight
occasions
,
but
these
proposals
were
invariably
rejected

tsedenbal
,
allowed

defense
,
being
the
first
time
that

====
relations
with
china
====
in
the
early
years
of

the
time
of
the
sino-soviet
split

tsedenbal
decisively
sided
with

union
and
incurred
china
's
wrath.
despite
this
,
the
two
countries
managed
to
sign
a
border
treaty

in

''
was
written
onto

''
during

being
critical
of
the

for
his
more
independent

policy.
====
other

mongolia
under

views
on
the
incorporation

mongolia
in

was
an
adamant
supporter
of
the
incorporation
of
mongolia
into
the
ussr
,
particularly
in
the
<integer>s
and
<integer>s.
years
earlier
in
<year>
,
tsedenbal
and
others
went
to
marshal
choibalsan
,
demanding
that
mongolia
petition
to
be
permitted
to
join
the
soviet
union
,
noting
on
the
example
of
tuva.
in
response
,
he
was
severely
rebuked.
the
only
other
eastern
bloc
leader
with
similar
aspirations
was
todor
zhivkov.
he
later
reversed
his
views
:
in
an
interview
,
his
son
zorig
told
that
tsedenbal
,
while
on
vacation
in
crimea
at
the
invitation
of
leonid
brezhnev
,
had
exchanged
views
with
him
on
the
topic.
at
one
point
,
brezhnev
asked
him
,
``
why
not
join
us
?
''
initially
,
tsedenbal
attempted
to
evade
the
question.
after
brezhnev
became
irritated
and
repeated
the
question
,
tsedenbal
responded
,
``
as
the
head
of
state
of
mongolia
,
i
have
one
thing
to
say.
we
are
ready
to
cooperate

the
most
important
condition
that
we
remain
an

''
==
ousting
==
tsedenbal
was
forced
into
retirement
in
august
<year>
in
a
soviet-sponsored
move
,
officially
on
the
account
of
his
old
age
and
mental
weakness
but
at
least
partly
because
of
his
opposition
to
the
process
of
sino-soviet
rapprochement
that
had
started
with
leonid
brezhnev
's
tashkent
speech
in
march
<year>.
jambyn

but
no

was
an
australian
soil
physicist
and
hydrologist
,
internationally
recognised
for
his
contributions
to
the
understanding
of
movement
of
water
,
energy
and
gases.
while
he
never
performed
his
own
experimental
work
,
he
was
recognised
for
his
skills
in
mathematics
that
could
be
used
to
explain
physical
processes
and
solve
real
world
problems.his
interests
were
not
limited
to
environmental
mechanics
and
things
mathematical
,
but
included
a
keen
interest
in
the
arts.
he
was
a
published
poet
and
a
panellist
on
the
sulman
prize
for
architecture.
his
poetry
appears
in
anthologies
edited
by

==
research
==
the
major
and
most
recognised
area
of
philip
's
research
was
his
work
on
the
theory
of
infiltration.
he
derived
the
theory
for
one
dimensional
infiltration
and
developed
equations
which
described
the
infiltration
on
both
a
short
term
and
long
term
scale
,
with
the
revelation
that
when
ponded
infiltration
in
uniform
soils
occurs
,
the
flow
will
approach
the
saturated
hydraulic
conductivity
:
i
=
s
t
+
a
t
{
\displaystyle
i=s
{
\sqrt
{
t
}
}
\
+at
}
where
s
is
sorptivity
and
a
is
the
steady-state
infiltration
rate.
other
areas
of
research
include
:
examining
heat
and
mass
transfer
in
soils.
philip
also
considered
the
importance
of
relationships
between
organisms
and
the
environment.
this
included
theories
on
plant
canopies
,
with
particular
focus
on
investigation
of
crop
stomatal
or
surface
resistances.
philip
was
also
responsible
for
the
construction
of
the
soil
plant
atmosphere
continuum
which
is
used
to
explain
the
transfer
of
water
within
transpiration
paths
,
a
concept
which
has
since
been
expanded
upon.
philip
also
studied
advection
,
the
horizontal
movement
of
atmospheric
properties
e.g.
temperature
and
while
his
analysis
and
solutions
were
not
completed
,
his
initial
work
has
been
important
for
development
of
solutions
to
problems
such
as
long-term
flux
assessments.

life
and

houthakker
was
born
in
amsterdam
to
a
dutch-jewish
family.
his
father
was
a
prominent
art
dealer.
as
a
teenager
he
lived
through
the
nazi
occupation
of
the
netherlands
and
,
according
to
an
interview
he
gave
to
the
valley
news
,
was
once
arrested
by
the
gestapo
but
escaped
and
was
sheltered
for
some
months
by
a
roman
catholic
family.
he
completed
his
graduate
work
at
the
university
of
amsterdam
in
<year>.
he
taught
at
stanford
university
from
<year>
to

and
then
completed
the
rest
of
his
career
at
harvard
university.
in
<year>
he
was
elected
as
a
fellow
of
the

houthakker
served
on
president
nixon
's
council
of
economic
advisers
from
<year>
to
<year>
,
where
he
advocated
replacing
the
international

rate
system

flexible
peg.
houthakker
's
contributions
to
economic
theory
have
been
summarized
by
pollak
(

.
he
is
particularly
well
known
for
the
strong
axiom
of
revealed
preference
,
to
which
his
name
is
often
attached.
this
paper
reconciles
paul
samuelson
's
revealed
preference
approach
to
demand
theory
with
the
earlier
ordinal
utility
approach
of
eugene
slutsky
and
sir
john
hicks
,
by
showing
that
demand
functions
satisfy
his
strong
axiom
if
and
only
if
they
can
be
generated
by
maximising
a
set
of
preferences
that
are
``
well-behaved
''
in
the
sense
that
they
satisfy
the
axioms
of
choice
theory
,
that
is
,
they
are
reflexive
,
transitive
,
complete
,
monotonic
,
convex
and
continuous—essentially
the
conditions
required
for
a
hicksian
approach
to
demand
theory.

a
<year>
decree
,
known
as
the
security
statute
,
was
implemented
by
turbay
's
administration.
the
security
statute
gave
the
military
an
increased
degree
of
freedom
of
action
,
especially
in
urban
areas
,
to
detain
,
interrogate
and
eventually
judge
suspected

or
their
collaborators
before

human

personalities
and
opposition
groups
complained
about
an
increase
in
the
number
of
arbitrary
detentions
and
acts
of

as
a
result.
although
the
security
statute
allegedly
benefited
some
of

such
as
the
capture
of
most
of
the
m<integer>

structure
and
many
of
the
guerrilla
group
's
urban
cells
,
the
measure
became
highly
unpopular
inside

outside

promoting
some
measure
of
public
sympathy
for
the
victims
of
the
real
or
perceived
military
abuses
whether
they
were

presented
a
complicated
challenge
to

avoided
deciding

through
the
use

instead
eventually
agreed

that
a
mostly
peaceful
resolution
to

has
been
generally
considered
as
a
positive
aspect
of
turbay

,
as
seen
by
later

turbay
was
seen
as
being
at
odds

<year>
,
hodgkin
was
a
member

==
pre-war
research
==
hodgkin
started
conducting
experiments
on
how
electrical
activity
is
transmitted
in
the
sciatic
nerve
of
frogs
in
july
<year>.
he
found
that
a
nerve
impulse
arriving
at
a
cold
or
compression
block
,
can
decrease
the
electrical
threshold
beyond
the
block
,
suggesting
that
the
impulse
produces
a
spread
of
an
electrotonic
potential
in
the
nerve
beyond
the
block.
in
<year>
,
hodgkin
was
invited
by
herbert
gasser
,
then
director
of
the
rockefeller
institute
in
new
york
city
,
to
work
in
his
laboratory
during
<year>–<integer>.
there
he
met
rafael
lorente
de
nó
and
kenneth
stewart
cole
with
whom
he
ended
up
publishing
a
paper.
during
that
year
he
also
spent
time
at
the
woods
hole
marine
biological
laboratory
where
he
was
introduced
to
the
squid
giant
axon
,
which
ended
up
being
the
model
system
with
which
he
conducted
most
of
the
research
that
eventually
led
to
his
nobel
prize.
in
spring
<year>
he
visited
joseph
erlanger
at
washington
university
in
st.
louis
who
told
him
he
would
take
hodgkin
's
local
circuit
theory
of
nerve
impulse
propagation
seriously
if
he
could
show
that
altering
the
resistance
of
the
fluid
outside
a
nerve
fibre
made
a
difference
to
the
velocity
of
nerve
impulse
conduction.
working
with
single
nerve
fibres
from
shore
crabs
and
squids
,
he
showed
that
the
conduction
rate
was
much
faster
in
sea
water
than
in
oil
,
providing
strong
evidence
for
the
local
circuit
theory.after
his
return
to
cambridge
he
started
collaborating
with
andrew
huxley
who
had
entered
trinity
as
a
freshman
in
<year>
,
three
years
after
hodgkin.
with
a
£<integer>
equipment
grant
from
the
rockefeller
foundation
,
hodgkin
managed
to
set
up
a
similar
physiology
setup
to
the
one
he
had
worked
with
at
the
rockefeller
institute.
he
moved
all
his
equipment
to
the
plymouth
marine
laboratory
in
july
<year>.
there
,
he
and
huxley
managed
to
insert
a
fine
cannula
into
the
giant
axon
of
squids
and
record
action
potentials
from
inside
the
nerve
fibre.
they
sent
a
short
note
of
their
success
to
nature
just
before
the
outbreak

war
ii.
==
wartime
activities
==
despite
his
quaker
upbringing
,
hodgkin
was
eager
to
join
the
war
effort
as
contact
with
the
nazis
during
his
stay
in
germany
in
<year>
had
removed
all
his
pacifist
beliefs.
his
first
post
was
at
the
royal
aircraft
establishment
where
he
worked
on
issues
in
aviation
medicine
,
such
as
oxygen
supply
for
pilots
at
high
altitude
and
the
decompression
sickness
caused
by
nitrogen
bubbles
coming
out
of
the
blood.
in
february
<year>
he
transferred
to
the
telecommunications
research
establishment
(

where
he
worked
on
the
development
of
centimetric
radar
,
including
the
design
of

and
lived
in
a
local
guest

moved
to

service

upon

hodgkin
was
able
to
restart
his
experiments
in
collaboration
with
bernard
katz
and
his
pre-war
collaborator
andrew
huxley.
they
spent
the
summers
of
<year>
,
<year>
,
and
<year>
at
the
plymouth
marine
laboratory
where
they
continued
to
measure
resting
and
action
potentials
from
inside
the
giant
axon
of
the
squid.
together
with
katz
,
he
provided
evidence
that
the
permeability
of
the
neuronal
cell
membrane
for
sodium
increased
during
an
action
potential
,
thus
allowing
sodium
ions
to
diffuse
inward.
the
data
they
had
obtained
in
<year>
resulted
in
a
series
of
five
papers
published
in
the
journal
of
physiology
that
described
what
became
later
known
as
the
hodgkin–huxley
model
of
the
action
potential
and
eventually
earned
hodgkin
and
huxley
the
nobel
prize
in
physiology
or
medicine.
building
on
work
by
kenneth
s.
cole
they
used
a
technique
of
electrophysiology
,
known
as
the
voltage
clamp
to
measure
ionic
currents
through
the
membranes
of
squid
axons
,
while
holding
the
membrane
voltage
at
a
set
level.
they
proposed
that
the
characteristic
shape
of
the
action
potential
is
caused
by
changes
in
the
selective
permeability
of
the
membrane
for
different
ions
,
specifically
sodium
,
potassium
,
and
chloride.
a
model
that
relies
on
a
set
of
differential
equations
and
describes
each
component
of
an
excitable
cell
as
an
electrical
element
was
in
good
agreement
with
their
empirical
measurements.
the
cell
membrane
depolarisation
sequence
where
a
small
depolarization
leads
to
an
increase
in
sodium
permeability
,
which
leads
to
influx
of
sodium
ions
,
which
in
turn
depolarizes
the
membrane
even
more
is
now
known
as
the
hodgkin
cycle.in
addition
,
hodgkin
and
huxley
's
findings
led
them
to
hypothesize
the
existence
of
ion
channels
on
cell
membranes
,
which
were
confirmed
only
decades
later.
confirmation
of
ion
channels
came
with
the
development
of
the
patch
clamp
leading
to
a
nobel
prize
in
<year>
for
erwin
neher
and
bert
sakmann
,
and
in
<year>
for
roderick
mackinnon.after
establishing
ion
movements
across
a
selectively
permeable
cell
membrane
as
the
mechanism
of
the
action
potential
,
hodgkin
turned
his
attention
to
how
the
ionic
interchange
that
occurs
during
the
action
potential
could
be
reversed
afterwards.
together
with
richard
keynes
he
demonstrated
that
in
addition
to
the
changes
in
permeability
that
lead
to
an
action
potential
there
is
a
secretory
mechanism
that
ejects
sodium
and
absorbs
potassium
against
the
electrochemical
gradients.
a
few
year
later
,
the
danish
scientist
jens
christian
skou
discovered
the
enzyme
na+/k+-atpase
that
uses
atp
to
export
three
sodium
ions
in
exchange
for
two
potassium
ions
that
are
imported
,
for
which
he
received
the
nobel
prize
in
chemistry
in
<year>.
hodgkin
was
nominated
for
the
nobel
prize
in
physiology
or
medicine

in

,
he
was
told
by
swedish
journalists
that
he
,
huxley
,
and
eccles
had
been
awarded
the
nobel
prize.
this
turned
out
to
be
a
false
alarm
,
however
,
when
shortly
thereafter
it
was
announced
that
the
<year>
prize
was
awarded
to
georg
von
békésy.
it
was
only
two
years
later
that
hodgkin

it
was
renamed
the

smalley
institute
for
nanoscale
science

after
smalley
's
death
in

,
and
has
since
merged
with
the
rice
quantum
institute
,
becoming
the
smalley-curl
institute
(

in
<year>.smalley
's
latest
research
was
focused
on
carbon
nanotubes
,
specifically
focusing
on
the
chemical
synthesis
side
of
nanotube
research.
he
is
well
known
for
his
group
's
invention
of
the
high-pressure
carbon
monoxide
(
hipco
)
method
of
producing
large
batches
of
high-quality

smalley
spun
off
his
work
into
a
company
,
carbon

and
associated
nanotechnologies.
===
dispute
on
molecular
assemblers
===
he
was
an
outspoken
skeptic
of
the
idea
of
molecular
assemblers
,
as
advocated
by
k.
eric
drexler.
his
main
scientific
objections
,
which
he
termed
the
``
fat
fingers
problem
''
and
the
``
sticky
fingers
problem
''
,
argued
against
the
feasibility
of
molecular
assemblers
being
able
to
precisely
select
and
place
individual
atoms.
he
also
believed
that
drexler
's
speculations
about
apocalyptic
dangers
of
molecular
assemblers
threatened
the
public
support
for
development
of
nanotechnology.
he
debated
drexler
in
an
exchange
of
letters
which
were
published
in
chemical
&
engineering
news
as
a
point-counterpoint
feature.
==
advocacy
==
starting
in
the
late
<year>s
,
smalley
advocated
for
the
need
for
cheap
,
clean
energy
,
which
he
described
as
the
number
one
problem
facing
humanity
in
the
<integer>st
century.
he
described
what
he
called
``
the
terawatt
challenge
''
,
the
need
to
develop
a
new
power
source
capable
of
increasing
``
our
energy
output
by
a
minimum
factor
of
two
,
the
generally
agreed-upon
number
,
certainly
by
the
middle
of
the
century
,
but
preferably
well
before
that.
''
he
also
presented
a
list
entitled
``
top
ten
problems
of
humanity
for
next
<integer>
years
''
.
it
can
be
interesting
to
compare
his
list
,
in
order
of
priority
,
to
the
ten
threats
formulated
by
the
u.n.
's
high
level
threat
panel
in
<year>.
smalley
's
list
,
in
order
of
priority
,
was
:
energy
water
food
environment
poverty
terrorism
&
war
disease
education
democracy
populationsmalley
regarded
several
problems
as
interlinked
:
the
lack
of
people
entering
the
fields
of
science
and
engineering
,
the
need
for
an
alternative
to
fossil
fuels
,
and
the
need
to
address
global
warming.
he
felt
that
improved
science
education
was
essential
,
and
strove
to
encourage
young
students
to
consider
careers
in
science.
his
slogan
for
this
effort
was
``
be
a
scientist
,
save
the
world.
''
smalley
was
a
leading
advocate
of

suffering
from
hair
loss

васи́лий

ми́шин
)
(
january
<integer>
,
<year>
–
october
<integer>
,
<year>
)
was
a
soviet
engineer
and
a
prominent
rocketry
pioneer
,
best
remembered
for
the
failures
in
the
soviet
space
program
that
took
place
under
his
leadership.
mishin
was
born
in
byvalino
,
in
the
bogorodsky
uyezd
of
the
moscow
governorate
of
the
russian
empire
,
and
studied
mathematics
at
the
moscow
aviation
institute.mishin
was
a
soviet
rocket
scientist
and
one
of
the
first
soviet
specialists
to
see
nazi
germany
's
v<integer>
facilities
at
the
end
of
world
war
ii
,
along
with
others
such
as
sergey
korolev
,
who
preceded
him
as
the
okb<integer>
design
bureau
head
,
and
valentin
glushko
,
who
succeeded
him.mishin
worked
with
korolev
as
his
deputy
in
the
experimental
design
bureau
working
on
projects
such
as
the
development
of
the
first
soviet
icbm
as
well
in
the
sputnik
and
vostok
programs.
he
became
head
of
korolev
's
okb<integer>
design
bureau
and
was
the
chief
designer
after
korolev
's
death
in
<year>
,
during
surgery
to
remove
a
tumor
from
korolev
's
colon.
he
inherited
the
n1
rocket
program
,
intended
to
land
a
man
on
the
moon
,
but
which
turned
out
to
be
fatally
flawed
(
largely
due
to
lack
of
adequate
funding
)
.
n1
development
began
on
september
<integer>
,
<year>
,
a
decade
before
mishin
took
control.
it
was
selected
for
a
lunar
landing
mission
,
which
required
a
design
capable
of
putting
ninety-five
tons
of
cargo
into
orbit
,
up
from
fifty
and
later
seventy-five
ton
requirements
earlier
in
development.
under
korolev
,
a
precedent
of
forgoing
much
of
the
usual
ground
testing
had
been
begun.
according
to
korolev
,
this
was
because
proper
facilities
would
not
be
funded
,
and
it
would
also
allow
for
earlier
test
flights.
some
of
the
failures
mishin
faced
during
his
leadership
could
have
been
avoided
if
further
testing
had
been
conducted
at
this
stage.
to
handle
engine
failures
,
the
kord
system
was
created
under
mishin.
to
prevent
the
rocket
from
having
uneven
flight
that
would
result
from
the
unbalanced
thrust
caused
by
a
malfunctioning
motor
,
the
faulty
motor
and
the
motor
opposite
it
in
the
rocket
base
would
be
turned
off.
kord
would
also
make
the
calculations
necessary
to
compensate
for
the
missing
motors
,
which
would
allow
the
same
flight
path
to
be
maintained.the
n1
,
despite
its
necessity
for
planned
missions
,
was
never
successfully
flown.
the
first
test
flight
,
on
february
<integer>
,
<year>
,
had
internal
plumbing
issues
which
led
to
a
fire
one
minute
in.
it
did
,
however
,
demonstrate
the
kord
system
working
successfully
as
well
as
proper
deployment
of
the
ejection
safety
system.
the
second
launch
,
on
july
<integer>
,
experienced
failure
seconds
after
ignition
,
causing
the
rocket
to
fall
back
on
the
launchpad
and
create
significant
damage.
the
third
n1
launch
occurred
on
june
<integer>
,
<year>
,
after
improvements
were
made
to
kord
,
the
cabling
,
and
fuel
pumps
,
and
the
addition
of
an
extinguishment
system
and
filters.
before
the
launch
,
the
individual
engines
were
further
tested
and
the
launchpad
was
repaired.
for
the
first
time
all
thirty
engines
of
the
first
stage
fired
successfully
,
which
was
the
cause
of
the
failure
of
the
flight.
when
all
engines
fired
together
,
it
created
unexpectedly
high
roll
(
rotation
along
the
axis
of
thrust
)
,
which
was
beyond
the
strength
of
the
compensating
vernier
engines
,
designed
to
keep
stable
flight.
this
was
another
failure
that
might
have
been
prevented
with
proper
ground
testing.for
the
fourth
and
what
would
become
the
final
flight
of
the
n1
,
further
refinements
were
made
,
including
four
additional
vernier
engines
,
additional
heat
shielding
for
internal
components
,
a
new
digital
control
system
,
and
additional
sensors
paired
with
a
high
speed
relay
system.
the
soviet
space
program
was
now
eyeing
creating
a
base
on
the
moon
,
but
first
needed
to
finally
succeed
with
this
design.
the
launch
was
on
november
<integer>
,
<year>
,
with
a
mishin
approved
flight
plan
to
orbit
the
moon
forty-two
times
,
with
flight
activities
such
as
taking
pictures
of
future
landing
sites
,
before
returning
to
earth
on
december
<integer>.
the
rocket
preceded
farther
than
its
predecessors
,
but
shortly
before
the
first
stage
was
to
separate
one
engine
caught
fire
,
causing
the
entire
structure
to
explode
,
but
not
before
the
escape
system
activated.despite
his
skills
in
rocketry
,
mishin
was
not
known
as
an
able
administrator.
he
is
often
blamed
for
the
failure
of
the
program
to
put
a
man
on
the
moon
,
and
faced
criticisms
for
his
alcohol
consumption.
he
was
described
by
soviet
premier
nikita
khrushchev
as
``
not
[
having
]
the
slightest
idea
how
to
cope
with
the
many

,
the
management
of

had
been
loaded
onto

''
in

criticised
mishin
's
``

for
him
to
be
cited
in
the
official
report
into
the
soyuz

,
which
killed
vladimir
komarov.
leonov
described
mishin
as
``

over-reluctant
to
take
risks
and
bad
at

other
failures
during

===
legacy
===
in
august
<year>
in
a
roundtable
interview
in
prospect
magazine
,
adair
turner
supported
the
idea
of
new
global
taxes
on
financial
transactions
,
warning
that
the
``
swollen
''
financial
sector
paying
excessive
salaries
had
grown
too
big
for
society.
lord
turner
's
suggestion
that
a
``
tobin
tax
''
–
named
after
james
tobin
–
should
be
considered
for
financial
transactions
made
headlines
around
the
world.
tobin
's
tobit
model
of
regression
with
censored
endogenous
variables
(
tobin
<year>a
)
is
a
standard
econometric
technique.
his
``
q
''
theory
of
investment
(
tobin
<year>
)
,
the
baumol–tobin
model
of
the
transactions
demand
for
money
(
tobin
<year>
)
,
and
his
model
of
liquidity
preference
as
behavior
toward
risk
(
the
asset
demand
for
money
)
(
tobin
<year>b
)
are
all
staples
of
economics
textbooks.
in
his
<year>
article
tobin
also
led
the
way
in
showing
how
to
deal
with
utility
maximization
under
uncertainty
with
an
infinite
number
of
possible
states.
as
palda
explains
``
one
way
to
get
out
of
the
mess
of
figuring
out
asset
prices
using
a
model
of
maximizing
the
expected
utility
of
investing
in
stocks
is
to
make
assumptions
about
either
preferences
or
the
probabilities
of
the
different
possible
states
of
the
world.
nobellist
james
tobin
(
<year>
)
took
this
line
and
discovered
that
in
some
cases
you
do
not
need
to
worry
about
the
utility
of
income
in
thousands
of
states
,
and
the
attached
probabilities
,
to
solve
the
consumer
's
choice
on
how
to
spread
income
among
states.
when
preferences
contain
only
a
linear
and
a
squared
term
(
a
case
of
diminishing
returns
)
or
the
probabilities
of
different
stock
returns
follow
a
normal
distribution
(
an
equation
that
contains
a
linear
and
squared
terms
as
parameters
)
,
a
simple
formulation
of
a
person
's
investment
choices
becomes
possible.
under
tobin
's
assumptions
we
can
reformulate
the
person
's
decision
problem
as
being
one
of
trading
off
risk
and
expected
return.
risk
,
or
more
precisely
the
variance
of
your
investment
portfolio
creates
spread
in
the
returns
you
expect.
people
are
willing
to
assume
more
risk
only
if
compensated
by
a
higher
level
of
expected
return.
one
can
thus
think
of
a
tradeoff
people
are
willing
to
make
between
risk
and
expected
return.
they
invest
in
risky
assets
to
the
point
at
which
their
willingness
to
trade
off
risk
and
return
is
equal
to
the
rate
at
which
they
able
to
trade
them
off.
it
is
difficult
to
exaggerate
how
brilliant
is
the
simplification
of
the
investment
problem
that
flows
from
these
assumptions.
instead
of
worrying
about
the
investor
's
optimization
problem
in
potentially
millions
of
possible
states
of
the
world
,
one
need
only
worry
about
how
the
investor
can
trade
off
risk
and
return
in
the
stock
market.

the

were
initially

,
but
continued
to
be

achieve
the
national
goal
of
economic
and
social
progress
with
prosperity
reaching
down
to
the
masses
,
there
existed
a
choice
of
methods.
first
,
there
was
the
choice
between
the
democratic
and
dictatorial
systems
,
the
latter
prevailing
in
communist
countries.
on
this
,
the
choice
was
easy
as
filipinos
had
long
been
committed
to
the
democratic
method.
with
the
democratic
mechanism
,
however
,
the
next
choice
was
between
free
enterprise
and
the
continuing
of
the
controls
system.
macapagal
stated
the
essence
of
free
enterprise
in
layman
parlance
in
declaring
before
congress
on
january
<integer>
,
<year>
,
that
``
the
task
of
economic
development
belongs
principally
to
private
enterprise
and
not
to
the
government.
before
independence
there
was
free
enterprise
in
the
philippines
under
presidents
manuel
quezon
,
sergio
osmeña
and
manuel
roxas.
in
<year>
president
elpidio
quirino
deviated
from
free
enterprise
launching
as
a
temporary
emergency
measure
the
system
of
exchange
and
import
controls.
the
controls
system
was
carried
on
by
president
magsaysay
and
garcia.the
first
fundamental
decision
macapagal
had
to
make
was
whether
to
continue
the
system
of
exchange
controls
of
quirino
,
magsaysay
and
garcia
or
to
return
to
the
free
enterprise
of
quezon
,
osmena
and
roxas.
it
had
been
his
view
since
he
was
a
congressman
for
eight
years
that
the
suitable
economic
system
for
filipinos
was
free
enterprise.
so
on
january
<integer>
,
<year>
,
after
working
for
<integer>
straight
hours
he
signed
a
central
bank
decree
abolishing
exchange
controls
and
returning
the
country
to
free
enterprise.during
the
<integer>
days
available
to
make
a
decision
on
choice
between
controls
and
free
enterprise
,
between
his
inauguration
as
president
and
before
the
opening
of
congress
,
macapagal
's
main
adviser
was
governor
andres
castillo
of
the
central
bank.
further
reform
efforts
by
macapagal
were
blocked
by
the
nacionalistas
,
who
dominated
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
senate
at
that
time.
nonetheless
,
macapagal
was
able
to
achieve
steady
economic
progress
,
and
annual
gdp
growth
averaged
at
<decimal>
%
for
<year>–<integer>.
====
socio-economic
program
====
the
removal
of
controls
and
the
restoration
of
free
enterprise
was
intended
to
provide
only
the
fundamental
setting
in
which
macapagal
could
work
out
economic
and
social
progress.
a
specific
and
periodic
program
for
the
guidance
of
both
the
private
sector
and
the
government
was
an
essential
instrument
to
attain
the
economic
and
social
development
that
constituted
the
goal
of
his
labors.such
a
program
for
his
administration
was
formulated
under
his
authority
and
direction
by
a
group
of
able
and
reputable
economic
and
business
leaders
the
most
active
and
effective
of
which
was
sixto
roxas
iii.
from
an
examination
of
the
planned
targets
and
requirements
of
the
five-year
program
–
formally
known
as
the
five-year
socio-economic
integrated
development
program
–
it
could
be
seen
that
it
aimed
at
the
following
objectives.
immediate
restoration
of
economic
stability
;
alleviating
the
plight
of
the
common
man
;
and
establishing
a
dynamic
basic
for
future
growth.free
enterprise
was
restored
with
decontrol.
the
five-year
economic
program
had
been
prescribed.
land
reform
abolishing
tenancy
had
been
launched.
these
were
essential
foundations
for
economic
and
social
progress
for
the
greatest
number.the
essential
foundations
having
been
laid
,
attention
must
then
be
turned
to
the
equally
difficult
task
of
building
the
main
edifice
by
implementing
the
economic
program.
although
the
success
of
macapagal
's
socio-economic
program
in
free
enterprise
inherently
depended
on
the
private
sector
,
it
would
be
helpful
and
necessary
for
the
government
to
render
active
assistance
in
its
implementation
by
the
citizens.such
role
of
the
government
in
free
enterprise
,
in
the
view
of
macapagal
,
required
it
(
<integer>
)
to
provide
the
social
overhead
like
roads
,
airfields
and
ports
that
directly
or
proximately
promote
economic
growth
,
(
<integer>
)
to
adopt
fiscal
and
monetary
policies
salutary
to
investments
,
and
most
importantly
(
<integer>
)
to
serve
as
an
entrepreneur
or
promote
of
basic
and
key
private
industries
,
particularly
those
that
require
capital
too
large
for
businessmen
to
put
up
by
themselves.
among
the
enterprises
he
selected
for
active
government
promotion
were
integrated
steel
,
fertilizer
,
pulp
,
meat
canning
and
tourism.
====
land
reform
====
like
ramon
magsaysay
,
president
diosdado
macapagal
came
from
the
masses.
he
savored
calling
himself
the
``
poor
boy
from
lubao
''
.
ironically
,
he
had
little
popularity
among
the
masses.
this
could
be
attributed
to
an
absence
any
charismatic
appeal
owing
to
his
stiff
personality.
but
despite
this
,
macapagal
had
certain
achievements.
foremost
of
these
was
the
agricultural
land
reform
code
of
<year>
(
republic
act
no.
<integer>
)
which
provided
for
the
purchase
of
private
farmlands
with
the
intention
of
distributing
them
in
small
lots
to
the
landless
tenants
on
easy
term
of
payment.
it
is
a
major
development
in
history
of
land
reform
in
the
philippines
,
in
comparison
with
the
previous
agrarian
legislation
,
the
law
lowered
the
retention
limit
to
<integer>
hectares
,
whether
owned
by
individuals
or
corporations.
it
removed
the
term
``
contiguous
''
and
established
the
leasehold
system.
the
share-tenancy
or
the
kasama
system
was
prohibited.
it
formulated
a
bill
of
rights
that
assured
agricultural
workers
the
right
to
self-organization
and
to
a
minimum
wage.
it
also
created
an
office
that
acquired
and
distributed
farmlands
and
a
financing
institution
for
this
purpose.
the
major
flaw
of
this
law
was
,
however
,
that
it
had
several
exemptions
,
such
as
ort
(
big
capital
plantations
established
during
the
spanish
and
american
periods
)
;
fishponds
,
saltbeds
,
and
lands
primarily
planted
to
citrus
,
coconuts
,
cacao
,
coffee
,
durian
,
and
other
similar
permanent
trees
;
landholdings
converted
to
residential
,
commercial
,
industrial
,
or
other
similar
non-agricultural
purposes.it
was
viewed
that
the
<integer>-hectare
retention
limit
was
just
too
high
for
the
growing
population
density.
moreover
,
this
law
merely
allowed
the
transfer
of
the
landlordism
from
one
area
to
another.
this
was
because
landlords
were
paid
in
bonds
,
which
he
could
use
to
purchase
agricultural
lands.
likewise
,
the
farmer
was
free
to
choose
to
be
excluded
from
the
leasehold
arrangements
if
he
volunteered
to
give
up
the
landholdings
to
the
landlord.within
two
years
after
the
law
was
implemented
,
no
land
was
being
purchased
under
its
term
and
conditions
caused
by
the
peasants
'
inability
to
purchase
the
land.
besides
,
the
government
seemed
lacking
of
strong
political
will
,
as
shown
by
the
congress
'
allotment
of
only
one
million
philippine
pesos
for
the
implementation
of
this
code.
at
least
php200
million
was
needed
within
a
year
from
the
enactment
and
implementation
of
the
code
,
and
php300
million
in
the
next
three
years
for
the
program
to
be
successful.
however
,
by
<year>
,
the
code
had
benefited
only
<integer>
,
<integer>
peasants
covering
<integer>
estates
,
at
the
cost
of
php57
million
to
the
government.
consequently
,
by
the
<year>s
,
the
farmers
ended
up
tilling
less
land
,
with
their
share
in
the
farm
also
being
less.
they
incurred
more
debts
,
depending
on
the
landlord
,
creditors
,
and
palay
buyers.
indeed
,
during
the
administration
of
macapagal
,
the
productivity
of
the
farmers
further
declined.
====
anti-corruption
drive
====
one
of
macapagal
's
major
campaign
pledges
had
been
to
clean
out
the
government
corruption
that
had
proliferated
under
former
president
garcia.
the
administration
also
openly
feuded
with
filipino
businessmen
fernando
lopez
and
eugenio
lopez
,
brothers
who
had
controlling
interests
in
several
large
businesses.
the
administration
alluded
to
the
brothers
as
``
filipino
stonehills
who
build
and
maintain
business
empires
through
political
power
,
including
the
corruption
of
politicians
and
other
officials
''
.
in
the
<year>
election
,
the
lopezes
threw
their
support
behind
macapagal
's
rival
,
ferdinand
marcos
,
with
fernando

serving

running

=====
stonehill
controversy
=====
the
administration
's
campaign
against
corruption
was
tested
by
harry
stonehill
,
an
american
expatriate
with
a
$
<integer>-million
business
empire
in
the
philippines.
macapagal
's
secretary
of
justice
,
jose
w.
diokno
investigated
stonehill
on
charges
of
tax
evasion
,
smuggling
,
misdeclaration
of
imports
,
and
corruption
of
public
officials.
diokno
's
investigation
revealed
stonehill
's
ties
to
corruption
within
the
government.
macapagal
,
however
,
prevented
diokno
from
prosecuting
stonehill
by
deporting
the
american
instead
,
then
dismissing
diokno
from
the
cabinet.
diokno
questioned
macapagal
's
actions
,
saying
,
``
how
can
the
government
now
prosecute
the
corrupted
when
it
has
allowed
the
corrupter
to
go
?
''
diokno
later
served
as
a
senator
of
the
republic.
====
independence

====
macapagal
appealed
to
nationalist
sentiments
by
shifting
the
commemoration
of

independence
day.
on
may
<integer>

<year>
,
he
signed

as
a
special
public
holiday
in
commemoration
of
the
declaration
of

on
that
date
in
<year>.
the
change
became
permanent
in
<year>
with
the
signing
of
republic

no.
<integer>.
for
having
issued
his
<year>
proclamation
,
macapagal
is
generally
credited
with
having
moved
the
celebration
date
of
the
independence
day
holiday.
years
later
,
macapagal
told
journalist
stanley
karnow
the
real
reason
for
the
change
:
``
when
i
was
in
the
diplomatic
corps
,
i
noticed
that
nobody
came
to
our
receptions

the
fourth

but
went
to

so

to

the

effectively
gave

the

authority
to
pursue

claim
in

the
philippines
broke
diplomatic
relations
with
malaysia
after
the

had
included

in

it
was
revoked
in

because

in
the
interest

maphilindo
====
in
july
<year>
,
president
diosdado
macapagal
convened
a
summit
meeting
in
manila
in
which
a
nonpolitical
confederation
for
malaysia
,
the
philippines
,
and
indonesia
,
maphilindo
,
was
proposed
as
a
realization
of
josé
rizal
's
dream
of
bringing
together
the
malay
peoples
,
seen
as
artificially
divided
by
colonial
frontiers.maphilindo
was
described
as
a
regional
association
that
would
approach
issues
of
common
concern
in
the
spirit
of
consensus.
however
,
it
was
also
perceived
as
a
tactic
on
the
parts
of
jakarta
and
manila
to
delay
,
or
even
prevent
,
the
formation
of
the
federation
of
malaysia.
manila
had
its
own
claim
to
sabah
(
formerly
british
north
borneo
)
,
and
jakarta
protested
the
formation
of
malaysia
as
a
british
imperialist
plot.
the
plan
failed
when
sukarno
adopted
his
plan
of
``
konfrontasi
''
with
malaysia.
the
konfrontasi
,
or
confrontation
basically
aimed
at
preventing
malaysia
from
attaining
independence.
the
idea
was
inspired
onto
president
sukarno
by
the
partai
komunis
indonesia
(
pki
)
,
or
literally
the
indonesian
communist
party.
the
party
convinced
president
sukarno
that
the
formation
of
malaysia
is
a
form
of
neo-colonization
and
would
affect
tranquility
in
indonesia.
the
subsequent
development
of
asean
almost
certainly
excludes
any
possibility
of
the
project
ever
being
revived.

===
john
maynard
smith
was
born
in
london
,
the
son
of
the
surgeon
sidney
maynard
smith
,
but
following
his
father
's
death
in
<year>
,
the
family
moved
to
exmoor
,
where
he
became
interested
in
natural
history.
quite
unhappy
with
the
lack
of
formal
science
education
at
eton
college
,
maynard
smith
took
it
upon
himself
to
develop
an
interest
in
darwinian
evolutionary
theory
and
mathematics
,
after
having
read
the
work
of
old
etonian
j.
b.
s.
haldane
,
whose
books
were
in
the
school
's
library
despite
the
bad
reputation
haldane
had
at
eton
for
his
communism.
he
became
an
atheist
at
age
<integer>.on
leaving
school
,
maynard
smith
joined
the
communist
party
of
great
britain
and
started
studying
engineering
at
trinity
college
,
cambridge.
when
the
second
world
war
broke
out
in
<year>
,
he
defied
his
party
's
line
and
volunteered
for
service.
he
was
rejected
,
however
,
because
of
poor
eyesight
and
was
told
to
finish
his
engineering
degree
,
which
he
did
in
<year>.
he
later
quipped
that
``
under
the
circumstances
,
my
poor
eyesight
was
a
selective
advantage—it
stopped
me
getting
shot
''
.
the
year
of
his
graduation
,
he
married
sheila
matthew
,
and
they
later
had
two
sons
and
one
daughter
(
tony
,
carol
,
and
julian
)
.
between
<year>
and
<year>
,
he
applied
his
degree
to
military
aircraft
design.
===
second
degree
===
maynard
smith
,
having
decided
that
aircraft
were
``
noisy
and
old-fashioned
''
,
then
took
a
change
of
career
,
entering
university
college
london
to
study
fruit
fly
genetics
under
haldane.
after
graduating
he
became
a
lecturer
in
zoology
at
his
alma
mater
between
<year>
and
<year>
,
where
he
directed
the
drosophila
lab
and
conducted
research
on
population
genetics.
he
published
a
popular
penguin
book
,
the
theory
of
evolution
,
in
<year>
(
with
subsequent
editions
in
<year>
,
<year>
,
<year>
)
.
he
became
gradually
less
attracted
to
communism
and
became
a
less
active
member
,
finally
leaving
the
party
in
<year>
like
many
other
intellectuals
,
after
the
soviet
union
brutally
suppressed
the
hungarian
revolution
(
haldane
had
left
the
party
in
<year>
after
becoming
similarly
disillusioned
)
.
he
also
admitted
that
a

explicitly
informed
by
marxism
seemed
to
bear
little
fruit.
