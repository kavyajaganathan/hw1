was
a
yugoslav

croatian
communist
revolutionary
and
a
politician.
bakarić
helped
to
organise
the
partisan
resistance
in
the
independent
state
of
croatia
during
world
war
ii.
from
<year>
to
<year>
,
he
was
the
chairman
of
the
league
of
communists
of
croatia
and
as
such
was
a
close
collaborator
of
president
josip
broz
tito.
even
after
stepping
down
from
the
top
post
in
communist
hierarchy
in
the
socialist
republic
of
croatia
,
he
retained
much
influence

was
even
considered

be
the
most
influential

together
with
edvard
kardelj
,
he
belonged
to
the
more
liberal
wing

who
wanted

son
of
alfred

and
elise

silesia.
he
was

germany
after

in

,
being

in

was
an
economist
and
the
developer
of
the
employee
funds
plan
proposed
by
the
swedish
trade
union
confederation
in
the
<year>s.
he
studied
under
the

he
got
his
doctor
of
philosophy
degree
in
<year>
with
a
dissertation
labeled
swedish
labour
market
at
full
employment.
he
spent
most
of
his
work
life
at
the
swedish
trade
union
confederation
as
a
researcher.
meidner
died
on

in
lidingö
,
aged
<integer>.
==
rehn–meidner
model
==
meidner
and
the
swedish
economist
gösta
rehn
were
responsible
for
the
rehn–meidner
model
for
economic
growth
as
promulgated
by
the
swedish
social
democratic
party
and
the
lo
,
the
blue-collar
trade
union.
the
rehn–meidner
model
was
first
proposed
in
<year>
and
for
over
the
next
twenty-five
years
was
the
basis
for
the
low-inequality
,
high-tech
oriented
,
rapid-innovation
swedish
economy
which
also
was
exposed
to
international
trade
and
became
export
oriented.
in
response
to
the
increasing
demand
on
the
part
of
workers
,
communities
and
women
for
a
share
of
the
excess
profits
(
permitted
by
a
capital-labor-state
wage
suppression
agreement
)
accumulated
in
an
increasingly
powerful
capitalist
sector
,
meidner
created
a
proposal
in
<year>
,
published
by
the
lo
,
that
called
for
requiring
all
companies
above
a
certain
size
to
issue
new
stock
shares
to
workers
so
that
within
twenty
years
the
workers
would
control
<integer>
per
cent
of
the
companies
they
worked
in.
this
policy
followed
in
meidner
's
career-long
efforts
to
build
a
step-wise
,
peaceful
,
institutionally
supported
transition
to
a
socialist
society
,
whose
carefully
crafted
incentive
structure
and
culture
would
allow
each
member
of
society
to
work
and
contribute
according
to
her
or
his
capacity
and
receive
social
support
according
to
her
or
his
needs.supported
by
important
swedish
policy
designer
walter
korpi
,
meidner
's
work
was
opposed
by
pro-capitalist
social
democrats
,
including
the
aggressively
conservative
finance
minister
kjell-olof
feldt
as
well
as
gösta
rehn
(
proponent
of
active
labour
market
policies
)
and
olof
palme.
the
increasing
ambitions
and
occasional
militancy
of
the
swedish
working
class
in
conjunction
with
meidner
's
careful
,
progressive
socialist
institutional
planning
politicized
the
swedish
capitalist
class
via
the
swedish
employers
association
(
saf
)
,
who
joined
other
countries
'
capitalist
classes
ramping
up
their
political
efforts
to
destroy
working
class
organizational
bases
and
to
promote
the
capital
deregulation
and
mobility
that
began
to
come
to
crisis
in
the
<year>s.
the
saf
's
response
was
to
model
their
political
and
policy
strategies
after
the
new
zealand
capitalist
class
'
campaign
which
had
successfully
destroyed
a
labor
movement
of
similar
strength
to
the
swedish
labor
movement.the
rehn–meidner
model
resulted
in
sweden
having
a
very
egalitarian
wage
system
so
that
wage
differentials
between
professions
was
very
low
,
fortifying
a
low
gini
coefficient.
however
,
in
the
absence
of
the
socialist
steps
urged
by
meidner
in
the
<year>s
the
economic
model
resulted
in
capital
concentration
(
despite
a
very
active
social
policy
,
sweden
has
one
of
the
highest
percentages
of
private
ownership
of
capital
in
the
world
)
to
the
point
where
in
the
late
<year>s
<integer>
per
cent
of
share
capital
was
held
by
the
top
<decimal>
per
cent
of
shareholders
and
<integer>
per
cent
by
the
top
<integer>
per
cent.
for
the
time
being
,
the
progressive
taxation
and
pro-middle
class
state
institutions
promoted
by
the
model
extensively
ameliorate
this
capital
concentration
as
can
be
seen
in
comparatively
successful
,
egalitarian
outcomes.

to
join
the

of

==
epigraphy
==
although
fell
was
an
accomplished
marine
biologist
at
harvard
university
,
he
is
best
known
for
three
books
which
claim
that
many
centuries
before
christopher
columbus
reached
america
,
celts
,
basques
,
phoenicians
,
egyptians
,
and
others
were
visiting
north
america.
his
interest
in
inscriptions
began
early
in
his
career
with
a
study
of
polynesian
petroglyphs
published
in
<year>
,
but
his
most
famous
work
came
much
later
,
starting
in
<year>
with
his
publication
of
america
b.c.
,
in
which
he
proposed
translations
of
inscriptions
found
on
rock
surfaces
and
artifacts
in
north
and
south
america
which
he
believed
to
be
written
in
old
world
scripts
and
languages.
he
followed
up
this
work
in
<year>
with
saga
america
and
in
<year>
with
bronze
age
america.
fell
's
epigraphic
work
was
not
well
received
in
academia.
critics
of
fell
's
work
routinely
dismissed
him
as
an
amateur
,
pointing
out
his
lack
of
formal
training
in
ancient
scripts
and
languages.a
scholarly
response
to
fell
's
work
was
prepared
by
ives
goddard
and
william
w.
fitzhugh
of
the
department
of
anthropology
at
the
smithsonian
institution.
they
stated
,
in
<year>
,
that
``
the
arguments
of
america
b.c.
are
unconvincing.
the
only
accepted
case
of
pre-columbian
european
contact
in
north
america
remains
the
norse
site
of
l'anse
aux
meadows
in
northern
newfoundland.
perhaps
some
day
credible
proof
of
other
early
european
contacts
will
be
discovered
in
the
new
world.
however
,
america
b.c.
does
not
contain
such
proof
and
does
not
employ
the
standard
linguistic
and
archeological
methods
that
would
be
necessary
to
convince
specialists
in
these
fields.
''
one
example
of
fell
's
claims
is
his
contention
in
saga
america
that
brendan
of
clonfert
may
have
reached
north
america
centuries
before
columbus.
this
is
based
on
fell
's
translation
,
published
in
the
magazine
wonderful
west
virginia
in
<year>
,
of
two
rock-cut
inscriptions
located
at
archaeological
sites
in
wyoming
and
boone
counties
,
west
virginia.
according
to
fell
,
these
inscriptions
narrate
the
story
of
christ
's
nativity
and
are
written
in
an
old
irish
script
called
ogham
,
dating
back
to
the
<integer>th
or
<integer>th
century
ad.
this
led
to
the
publication
of
articles
in
the
journal
the
west
virginia
archeologist
that
were
highly
critical
of
fell
's
conclusions
and
methodology
,
including
a
<year>
article
by
archaeologist
and
historian
w.
hunter
lesser
describing
fell
's
claims
as
pseudoscientific
and
unreliable.
in
<year>
lawyers
monroe
oppenheimer
and
willard
wirtz
wrote
an
article
based
on
opinions
of
academic
archaeologists
and
linguists
to
dispute
that
the
inscription
is
written
in
ogham
script.
they
further
accused
fell
of
deliberate
fraud.david
h.
kelley
,
an
archaeologist
at
the
university
of
calgary
who
is
credited
with
a
major
breakthrough
in
the
decipherment
of

,
complained
about
fell
in
a
<year>
essay
:
``

the

and
lack
of

''
in
the

essay
,
however
,
kelley
went
on
to
state
that
``
i
have
no
personal
doubts
that
some
of
the

have
been
reported

''
kelley
concluded
:
``
despite
my
occasional
harsh
criticism
of

treatment

it
should
be
recognized
that
without

work
there
would
be
no

problem
to
perplex

we
need
to
ask

what

has
done

also
where
we

work

evsey
domar
was
a
keynesian
economist.
he
made
contributions
to
three
main
areas
of
economics
:
economic
history
,
comparative
economics
and
economic
growth.
in
<year>
he
advanced
the
idea
that
economic
growth
served
to
lighten
the
deficit
and
the
national
debt.
during
the
cold
war
he
was
also
an
expert
on
soviet
economics.
he
is
most
known
for
developing
,
independently
of
british
economist
roy
forbes
harrod
,
what
has
become
to
be
known
as
the
harrod–domar
model
of
economic
growth.
this
model
was
the
precursor
to
the
neoclassical
model
of
economic
growth
,
differing
mainly
in
its
restrictive
assumption
that
the
leontief
production
function
applied
,
which
meant
there
would
be
fixed
proportions
of
capital
and
labor
in
production
,
not
substitution
between
them.
in
the
model
,
economic
growth
was
unstable.
the
solow–swan
model
that
followed
several
years
later
borrowed
heavily
from
the
harrod-domar
model
and
used
a
variable
proportions

production
function.domar

moved
back

prior

ii.
for
a
period
during
the

,
he
was
interned
on
an
isolated
english
farm
as
an
``
enemy
alien
''
.
in
these
years
,
schumacher
captured
the
attention
of
john
maynard
keynes
with
a
paper
entitled
``
multilateral
clearing
''
that
he
had
written
between
sessions
working
in
the
fields
of
the
internment
camp.
keynes
recognised
the
young
german
's
understanding
and
abilities
,
and
he
was
able
to
have
schumacher
released
from
internment.
schumacher
helped
the
british
government
mobilise
economically
and
financially
during
world
war
ii
,
and
keynes
found
a
position
for
him
at
oxford

according
to
leopold

obituary
for
schumacher
,
when
``
multilateral
clearing
''
``
was
published
in
the
spring
of
<year>

it
caused
some
embarrassment
to
keynes

arranging
for
its

had
incorporated
the
text
almost
verbatim
in
his
famous
``

he
saw
oil
as

the

it
is
generally
thought
that
his

friend
leopold
kohr
,
brought
his
ideas
to
a
wider
audience.
one
of
his

is
that
we
can
not
consider
the

production
solved
if
it
requires
that
we
recklessly
erode
our
finite
natural
capital

benefits.
schumacher
's
work
coincided
with
the
growth
of
ecological
concerns
and
with
the
birth
of
environmentalism
,
and
he
became
a
hero
to
many
in
the
environmental
movement
and
community
movement.
in
<year>
,
he
was
awarded
the
prix
européen
de

charles
veillon
for
small

his
<year>
work
a
guide
for
the

is
both
a
critique
of
materialistic
scientism
and
an
exploration
of
the
nature
and
organisation
of
knowledge.
==
later
life
==
as
a
young
man
,
schumacher
was
a
dedicated
atheist
,
but
his
later
rejection
of
materialist
,
capitalist
,
agnostic
modernity
was
paralleled
by
a
growing
fascination
with
religion.
he
developed
an
interest
in
buddhism
,
but
beginning
in
the
late-<year>s
,
catholicism
heavily
influenced
his
thinking.
he
noted
the
similarities
between
his
own
economic
views
and
the
teaching
of
papal
encyclicals
on
socio-economic
issues
,
from
leo
xiii
's
``
rerum
novarum
''
to
pope
john
xxiii
's

,
as
well
as
with
the
distributism
supported
by
the
catholic
thinkers
g.
k.
chesterton
,
hilaire
belloc
,
and
vincent
mcnabb.
philosophically
,
he
absorbed
much
of
thomism
,
which
provided
an
objective
system
in
contrast
to
what
he
saw
as
the
self-centered
subjectivism
and
relativism
of
modern
philosophy
and
society.
he
also
was
greatly
interested
in
the
tradition
of
christian
mysticism
and
read
deeply
such
writers
as
st.
teresa
of
avila
and
thomas
merton.
these
were
all
interests
that
he
shared
with
his
friend
,
the
catholic
writer
christopher
derrick.
in
<year>
,
he
converted
to
catholicism.schumacher
gave
interviews
and
published
articles
for
a
wide
readership
in
his
later
years.
he
also
pursued
one
of
the
loves

:
gardening.
he
died
of

muth
(

september
<integer>

)
was
an
american
economist.
he
is
``
the
father
of
the
rational
expectations
revolution
in
economics
''
,
primarily
due
to
his
article
``
rational
expectations
and
the
theory
of
price
movements
''
from
<year>.
muth
earned
his
ph.d.
in
mathematical
economics
from
carnegie
mellon
university
,
and
was
in
<year>
the
first
recipient
of
the
alexander
henderson
award.
he
was
affiliated
with
carnegie
mellon
as
a
research
associate
from
<year>
until
<year>
,
as
an
assistant
professor
from
<year>
to
<year>
,
and
as
an
associate
professor
without
tenure
from
<year>
to
<year>.
he
was
a
full
professor
at
michigan
state
university
from
<year>
to
<year>
and
a
full
professor
at
indiana
university
from
<year>
until
his
retirement
in

muth
asserted
that
expectations
``
are
essentially
the
same
as
the
predictions
of
the
relevant
economic
theory.
''
although
he
formulated
the
rational
expectations
principle
in
the
context
of
microeconomics
it
has
subsequently
become
associated
with
macroeconomics
and
the
work
of
robert

work
with
holt
,
modigliani
,
and
simon
==
two
divergent
approaches
to
economic
modeling
,
which
have
later
become
cornerstones
of
modeling
of
economic
systems
,
originated
at
the
graduate
school
of
industrial
administration
(
gsia
)
at
carnegie
mellon
in
the
late
<year>s
and
early
<year>s.
at
the
same
time
as
john
muth
was
developing
the
concept
of
rational
expectations
,
herbert
a.
simon
had
been
refining
his
ideas
on
bounded
rationality
,
emphasizing
people
's
limited
computational
abilities.
together
with
their
two
colleagues
at
gsia
charles
c.
holt
and
franco
modigliani
,
muth
and
simon
collaborated
on
planning
production
,
inventories
,
and
work
force
(
<year>
)
,
a
book
on
problems
of
production
scheduling
and
inventory
management
for
the
firm.
their
goal
was
to
derive
tractable
,
operational
rules
that
could
easily
be
applied
in
practice.
rather
than
a
coincidence
that
the
two
apparently
contradictory
approaches
to
economic
modeling
were
developed
at
gsia
at
the
same
time
,
it
is
more
likely
that
fruitful
interaction
in
the
quest
to
answer
a
common
set
of
problems
led
the
two
researchers
to
two
different
solutions.
in
an
earlier
work
,
herb
simon
had
shown
that
with
quadratic
costs
and
under
a
certain
set
of
assumptions
about
the
probability
distributions
,
optimal
decision
rules
for
production
and
inventories
would
be
linear
functions
of
the
variables
describing
the
state.
in
his
model
,
firms
only
needed
to
take
into
account
the
expected
value
and
ignore
all
higher
moments
of
the
probability
distribution
of
future
sales.
this
result
,
known
as
certainty
equivalence
,
drastically
reduces
the
computational
burden
on
a
representative
decision
maker.
simon
's
result
that
decision
makers
only
focus
on
expected
values
of
stochastic
variables
was
very
sensitive
to
the
assumed
structure
of
the
problem
,
hence
indirectly
on
the
formulation
of
expectations.
this
lack
of
a
general
theory
of
expectations
was
an
unsatisfactory
state
of
affairs
and
proved
to
be
key
in
muth
's
approach
to
solve
the
problem
which
has
often
been
termed
interaction
between
expectations
and
reality.
in
his
article
from
<year>
,
muth
writes
:
``
to
make
dynamic
economic
models
complete
,
various
expectational
formulas
have
been
used.
there
is
,
however
,
little
evidence
to
suggest
that
the
presumed
relations
bear
a
resemblance
to
the
way
the
economy
works.
''
==
rationalization
of
friedman
's
adaptive
expectations
model
==
phillip
cagan
,
milton
friedman
and
others
used
the
ad
hoc
updating
rule
which
they
labeled
adaptive
expectations
to
forecast
the
hidden
state
y*
(
e.g.
,
permanent
income
)
.
in
a
<year>
paper
,
muth
answered
the
question
:
for
what
stochastic
process
for
y
will
adaptive
expectations
as
postulated
by
cagan
and
friedman
be
the
optimal
forecast
of
y*.
muth
's
approach
to
find
recursive
optimal
linear
forecast
of
a
``
hidden
''
state
vector
,
x
,
given
an
``
observer
''
,
y
is
very
similar
to
the
kalman
filter
,
presented
by
rudolf
kálmán
in
his
paper
from
the
same
year.
in
his
paper
``
optimal
properties
of
exponentially
weighted
forecasts
''
,
which
was
published
in
the
journal
of
the
american
statistical
association
in
<year>
,
muth
rationalized
friedman
's
adaptive
expectations
model
for
permanent
income.
he
did
this
by
reverse
engineering
a
stochastic
process
for
income
for
which
cagan
's
expectation
formula
equals
a
mathematical
expectation
of
future
values
conditioned
on
the
infinite
history
of
past
incomes.
among
muth
's
insights
was
that
the
stochastic
process
being
forecast
should
dictate
both
the
distributed
lag
and
the
conditioning
variables
that
people
use
to
forecast
the
future.
==
hypothesis
of
rational
expectations
==
in
``
rational
expectations
and
the
theory
of
price
movements
''
,
published
in
<year>
,
muth
put
forward
his
hypothesis
,
in
contrast
to
simon
,
that
``
expectations
,
since
they
are
informed
predictions
of
future
events
,
are
essentially
the
same
as
the
predictions
of
the
relevant
economic
theory.
''
muth
continued
,
``
at
the
risk
of
confusing
this
purely
descriptive
hypothesis
with
a
pronouncement
as
to
what
firms
ought
to
do
,
we
call
such
expectations
rational.
''
muth
's
notion
was
that
the
professors
[
of
economics
]
,
even
if
correct
in
their
model
of
man
,
could
do
no
better
in
predicting
than
could
the
hog
farmer
or
steelmaker
or
insurance
company.
the
notion
is
one
of
intellectual
modesty
...
.
the
common
sense
is
``
rationality
''
:
therefore
muth
called
the
argument
``
rational
expectations
''
.
==
legacy
==
muth
's
works
influenced
almost
every
area
of
economic
research
into
dynamic
problems.
of
course
we
knew
about
[
rational

]
.
muth
was
a
colleague
of

[
in

early

used
it
in

of
ours

people
were
aware
of
it
,
but
i
did
n't
understand
then
how
fundamental
a
difference
it
made
econometrically.
i
did
n't
realize
that
if
you
took
it
seriously
you
had
to
rethink
the
whole
question
of
testing
and
estimation.
i
guess
no
one
else
did
either
,
except
for
muth.
it
must
be
quite
an
experience
to
write
papers
that
radical
and
have
people
just
pat
you
on
the
head
and
say
'that
's
interesting
,
'
and
nothing
happens.
muth
's
role
in
the
history
of
economics
is
unusual.
like
hermann
heinrich
gossen
,
he
became
famous
for
one
idea
,
he
provided
the
analytical
key
to
developments
that
,
in
the
jargon
of
scientific
journalism
,
were
described
as
revolutionary
,
and
he
was
virtually
ignored
by
his
immediate
contemporaries.
however
,
whereas
gossen
had
no
influence
on
those
developments
,
his
key
results
being
independently
rediscovered
by
jevons
and
walras
,
the
rational
expectations
economics
of
the
<year>s
and
<year>s
was
a
direct
outgrowth
of
muth
's
seminal
idea.
in
fact
,
muth
's
contribution
is
one
of
the
relatively
few
instances
in
which
there
is
no
indication
that
the
history
of
economics
would
have
taken
about
the
same
course
in
its
absence.
it
was

contribution

===
the
theory
of
the
growth
of
the
firm
===
while
at
johns
hopkins
,
penrose
participated
in
a
research
project
on
the
growth
of
firms.
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
existing
theory
of
the
firm
was
inadequate
to
explain
how
firms
grow.
her
insight
was
to
realize
that
the
'firm
'
in
theory
is
not
the
same
thing
as
'flesh
and
blood
'
organizations
that
businessmen
call
firms.
this
insight
eventually
led
to
the
publication
of
her
second
book
,
the
theory
of
the
growth
of
the
firm
in
<year>.
in
the
introduction
to
the
book
,
she
writes
:
``
all
the
evidence
we
have
indicates
that
the
growth
of
firms
is
connected
with
the
attempts
of
a
particular
group
of
human
beings
to
do
something.
''
in
theorizing
about
companies
that
grow
,
dr.
penrose
wrote
:
``
there
are
important
administrative
restraints
on
the
speed
of
the
firm
's
growth.
human
resources
required
for
the
management
of
change
are
tied
to
the
individual
firm
and
so
are
internally
scarce.
expansion
requires
the
recruitment
of
more
such
resources.
new
recruits
can
not
become
fully
effective
overnight.
the
growth
process
is
,
therefore
,
dynamically
constrained.
''
===
resource-based
view
of
the
firm
===
penrose
is
considered
to
be
the
first
economist
who
posited
what
has
become
known
as
the
resource-based
view
of
the
firm.
strategic
resources
are
those
which
are
rare
,
difficult
to
duplicate
,
valuable
,
and
over
which
a
firm
has
control.
resources
can
be
raw
materials
,
such
as
a
gold
mine
or
oil
well
,
or
intellectual
,
such
as
patents
,
and
even

and
brands
(
such

characterised
as
``
among

earliest
proponents

reparations
for
the
former
west
indies
for
britain
's
colonial
wrongs
''
because
of
the
ideas
he
put
forward
in
this
work.
===
the
``
lewis
model
''
===
lewis
published
in
<year>
what
was
to
be
his
most
influential
development
economics
article
,
``
economic
development
with
unlimited
supplies
of
labour
''
(
manchester
school
)
.
in
this
publication
,
he
introduced
what
came
to
be
called
the
dual
sector
model
,
or
the
``
lewis
model
''
.lewis
combined
an
analysis
of
the
historical
experience
of
developed
countries
with
the
central
ideas
of
the
classical
economists
to
produce
a
broad
picture
of
the
development
process.
in
his
theory
,
a
``
capitalist
''
sector
develops
by
taking
labour
from
a
non-capitalist
backward
``
subsistence
''
sector.
the
subsistence
sector
is
governed
by
informal
institutions
and
social
norms
so
that
producers
do
not
maximize
profits
and
workers
can
be
paid
above
their
marginal
product.
at
an
early
stage
of
development
,
the
``
unlimited
''
supply
of
labour
from
the
subsistence
economy
means
that
the
capitalist
sector
can
expand
for
some
time
without
the
need
to
raise
wages.
this
results
in
higher
returns
to
capital
,
which
are
reinvested
in
capital
accumulation.
in
turn
,
the
increase
in
the
capital
stock
leads
the
``
capitalists
''
to
expand
employment
by
drawing
further
labour
from
the
subsistence
sector.
given
the
assumptions
of
the
model
(
for
example
,
that
the
profits
are
reinvested
and
that
capital
accumulation
does
not
substitute
for
skilled
labour
in
production
)
,
the
process
becomes
self-sustaining
and
leads
to
modernization
and
economic
development.the
point
at
which
the
excess
labour
in
the
subsistence
sector
is
fully
absorbed
into
the
modern
sector
,
and
where
further
capital
accumulation
begins
to
increase
wages
,
is
sometimes
called
the
lewisian
turning
point.
it
has
recently
been
widely
discussed
in
the
context
of
economic
development
in
china.
===
the
theory
of
economic
growth
(
<year>
)
===
in
his
<year>
book
,
the
theory
of
economic
growth
,
lewis
sought
to
``
provide
an
appropriate
framework
for
studying
economic
development
''
,
driven
by
a
combination
of
``
curiosity
and
of
practical
need.
''
during
the
industrial
revolution
,
england
was
experiencing
the
worst
economic
turmoil
of
its
time.
it
would
not
be
until
an
economic
enlightenment
took
place
that
cities
began
to
shift
towards
factories
and
labour-intensive
methods
of
production
as
they
experienced
giant
shifts
in
the
labour
and
agriculture
markets
,
thus
,
eventually
leading
to
higher
production
,
and
higher
income.
lewis
theorized
if
england
could
turn
its
misfortune
around
,
the
same
could
be
done
for
developing
countries
around
the
world.
his
theories
proved
true
for
some
countries
such
as
nigeria
and
barbados
,
as
they
would
see
some
economic
development.

the
attacks
finally
ended
in
<year>
once
the
sandinistas
took
control
of
the
country
,
and
somoza
was
exiled.
the
government
received
a
strong
backlash
from
the
public
,
and
the
opposition
claimed
that
carazo
had
failed
to
protect
costa
rica
's
sovereignty.
further
,
carazo
's
government
allowed
three
us
helicopters
to
touch
down
on
national
soil
to
facilitate
somoza
's
escape
from
nicaragua.
that
sent
the
president
's
critics
on
a
political
bashing
rampage
,
calling
the
matter
a
disrespect
to
national
sovereignty.
later
,
in
<year>
,
the
central
american
democratic
community
was
formed
in
san
josé
with
us
backing.
its
aim
was
to
isolate
nicaragua
from
the
rest
of
central
america
as
long
as
they
had
a
communist
regime
in
power.
another
big
move
was
in
<year>
,
when
carazo
's
government
broke
off
all
diplomatic
ties
with
fidel
castro
's
cuba.
carazo
's
government
was
plagued
by
economic
instability
and
social
unrest.
during
his
presidency
,
there
was
a
world
economic
recession.
petroleum
prices
were
at
historic
highs
,
and
the
value
of
costa
rica
's
main
crop
,
coffee
,
was
falling.
against
the
advice
of
his
minister
of
finance
,
hernán
sáenz
jiménez
,
and
the
international
monetary
fund
(
imf
)
,
carazo
instructed
the
central
bank
of
costa
rica
to
borrow
heavily
to
maintain
the
value
of
the
colón
,
the
local
currency
,
in
the
hope
that
an
economic
recovery
was
close
at
hand.
that
policy
eventually
became
unsustainable
,
leading
to
a
catastrophic
sudden
devaluation
in
september
<year>.
the
heavy
load
of
debt
that
the
central
bank
acquired
contributed
to
the
highest
rates
of
inflation
that
costa
rica
has
endured
ever
since.
after
stepping
down
as
president
in
<year>
,
carazo
became
a
well-known
critic
of
the
imf
and
other
global
financial
institutions.
in

,
he
campaigned
vigorously
against
the
central
american
free

(

.
==
later

carazo
played
a
leadership
role
in

west.
he
made
several
visits
to

==
career
==
in
the
late
<year>s
,
the
party
adopted
a
new
course
demanding
greater
autonomy
for
croatia
within
yugoslavia
and
freedoms
for
the
people.
her
policy
,
propagated
through
mass
rallies
,
became
a
movement
later
called
the
croatian
spring
,
being
one
of
the
'<integer>
student
revolutions.
consequently
,
dabčević-kučar
became
one
of
the
most
popular
political
leaders
at
the
time
,
being
affectionately
called
``
savka
,
queen
of
croatians
''
.
not
everyone
was
happy
with
the
new
course.
open
manifestations
of
croatian
nationalism
created
tensions
in
ethnically
mixed
areas
,
which
served
as
an
argument
for
the
yugoslav
people
's
army
and
more
conservative
elements
of
the
party
who
wanted
the
movement
suppressed.
at
the
same
time
,
the
croatian
leadership
was
also
challenged
by
a
student
movement
with
even
more
radical
demands.
in
december
<year>
tito
held
a
party
leadership
conference
in
karađorđevo
,
serbia
,
and
publicly
turned
against
the
croatian
spring
in
the
form
of
``
comradely
critic
''
,
(
an
internal
communist
way
to
openly
criticize
its
party
members
when
they
,
according
to
majority
opinion
,
do
not
follow
``
the

line
''
)
.
this
led
to
dabčević-kučar
's
response
to
the
critic
,
(
published
in
newspapers
during
december
)
in
which
she
accepted
all
criticism
except
those
intended
to
show
her
as
nationalist
,
and
enemy
of
the
socialist
self-governing
system
,
to
which
she
publicly
expressed
loyalty.
she
resigned
from
the
central
committee
of
the
croatian
communist
party
and
,
ultimately
,
from
public
life.
she
was
replaced
by
milka
planinc.
when
multi-party
democracy
finally
arrived
in
croatia
,
dabčević-kučar
and
tripalo
returned
to
the
public
stage
,
using
their
long-accumulated
reputation.
they
refused
to
endorse
a
single
party
,
and
instead
initiated
the
formation
of
a
broad
coalition
of
the
moderate
middle
,
called
the
coalition
of
people
's
accord.
the
coalition
failed
to
make
a
major
impact
at
the
<year>
elections
,
with
most
opting
for
franjo
tuđman
and
his
croatian
democratic
union
party.
with
the
coalition
falling
apart
,
dabčević-kučar
and
tripalo
formed
their
own
party
,
the
croatian
people
's
party
(
hns
)
,
in
late
<year>.
this
new
party
was
intended
to
attract
moderates
and
had
high
hopes
for
the

presidential
and

elections
,
being
perceived
as
the
strongest
opposition
party
in
croatia.
as
a
presidential
candidate
savka
dabčević
trailed
third
behind
dražen
budiša.
the
hns
refused
to
form
coalitions

other
opposition
parties
,
allowing
the
ruling
croatian
democratic
union
to
win
some
constituencies
with
less
than
fifth
of
all
votes.
with
the
party
humiliated
,
and
nearly
bankrupt
after
a
lavish

ineffective
campaign

left

made
a
presentation
to

committee
on

energy
in

the
scientific
level
of
the
debate
,
the
crucial
question
was
whether
the
``
threshold
theory
''
was
valid
or
whether
,
as
lewis
insisted
,
the
effects
of
radioactivity
were
``
linear
with
no
threshold
''
,
where
every
exposure
to
radiation
had
a
long-term
cumulative
effect.the
issue
of
linearity
versus
threshold
re-entered
the
debate
on
nuclear
fallout
in
<year>

when
ernest

a
back

when

newsreader.
(

the

the

his

lillian
(
helman
)
and
victor
rostow
,
were
active
socialists
,
and
named
walt
after
the
poet
walt
whitman.
rostow
's
father
,
victor
rostowsky
,
was
born
in
the
town
of
orekhov
near
odessa
in
<year>
,
and
was
involved
in
the
russian
socialist
movement
as
a
teenager
,
publishing
a
left-wing
newspaper
in
the
basement
of
his
parents
'
house
calling
for
the
overthrow
of
the
emperor
nicholas
ii.
in
<year>
,
at
the
age
of
<integer>
,
victor
rostowsky
boarded
a
ship
that
took
him
from
odessa
to
glasgow
and
another
ship
that
took
him
to
new
york.
upon
arriving
in
the
united
states
,
rostowsky
``
americanized
''
his
surname
to
rostow.
on
<day>
,
he
married
lillian
helman
,
the
intellectually
gifted
daughter
of
russian
jewish
immigrants
who
longed
go
to
college
,
but
as
her
family
was
too
poor
to
afford
higher
education
,
she
instead
encouraged
her
sons
to
attain
the
higher
education
she
wanted
for
herself.
like
the
rostowskys
,
the
helmans
were
ashkenazim
(
yiddish-speaking
jews
)
.
the
rostows
were
described
as
being
very
``
idealistic
''
immigrants
who
deeply
loved
their
adopted
country
and
named
their
three
sons
after
the
three
men
they
considered
to
be
the
greatest
americans
,
namely
eugene
v.
debs
,
walt
whitman
and
ralph
waldo
emerson.unlike
many
other
ashkenazi
jewish
immigrants
,
victor
rostow
always
spoke
to
his
children
in
english
rather
than
yiddish
as
he
felt
this
was
would
improve
their
chances
in
life.
rostow
's
brother
eugene
,
who
was
named
for
eugene
v.
debs
,
became
a
legal
scholar
,
and
his
brother
ralph
,
a
department
store
manager.
the
american
journalist
stanley
karnow
described
rostow
as
extremely
intelligent
with
a
``
brilliant
''
academic
record
that
saw
him
graduate
from
high
school
at
the
age
of
<integer>.
rostow
described
his
childhood
as
mostly
happy
with
the
only
dark
spots
being
that
sometimes
his
classmates
called
him
and
his
brothers
``
dirty
jews
''
.rostow
's
parents
closely
followed
events
in
russia
and
rostow
later
recalled
a
defining
moment
of
his
life
occurred
as
a
teenager
when
his
parents
invited
over
for
a
dinner
a
group
of
fellow
jewish
socialists
together
with
a
man
who
was
serving
as
a
purchasing
agent
for
the
soviet
government.
after
the
dinner
,
rostow
remembered
that
his
father
said
:
``
these
communists
took
over
the
tsarist
police
and
made
them
worse.
the
tsarist
police
persecuted
the
political
opposition
but
never
touched
their
families.
these
people
touch
families
too.
nothing
good
will
come
of
it
''
.
rostow
entered
yale
university
at
the
age
of
<integer>
on
a
full
scholarship
and
graduated
at
<integer>.
he
then
won
a
rhodes
scholarship
to
study
at
balliol
college
,
oxford
,
where
he
completed
a
b.litt.
degree.
at
oxford
,
rostow
became
friends
with
future
politicians
edward
heath
and
roy
jenkins
,
being
especially
close
to
the
latter.
in
<year>
,
during
the
edward
viii
abdication
crisis
,
he
assisted
broadcaster
alistair
cooke
,
who
reported
on
the
events
for
the
nbc
radio
network.
after
returning
to
yale
university
,
completing
his
ph.d.
in
<year>
,
he
started
teaching
economics
at
columbia
university.
==
professional
and
academic
career
==
during
world
war
ii
,
rostow
served
in
the
office
of
strategic
services
under
william
joseph
donovan.
among
other
tasks
,
he
participated
in
selecting
targets
for
us
bombardment.
nicholas
katzenbach
later
joked
:
``
i
finally
understand
the
difference
between
walt
and
me
[
...
]
i
was
the
navigator
who
was
shot
down
and
spent
two
years
in
a
german
prison
camp
,
and
walt
was
the
guy
picking
my
targets.
''
in
september
<year>
,
rostow
arrived
in
london
to
serve
as
an
intelligence
analyst
with
the
enemy
objectives
unit
,
serving
until
the
spring
of
<year>.in
january
<year>
,
rostow
was
given
the
task
of
identifying
the
key
industries
that
supported
the
german
war
economy.
as
an
intelligence
analyst
,
rostow
became
convinced
in
<year>
that
oil
was
germany
's
achilles
heel
,
and
if
the
united
states
army
air
force
were
to
target
the
romanian
oil
fields
together
with
the
plants
for
making
artificial
oil
and
oil
shortage
facilities
within
germany
itself
,
then
the
war
would
be
won
,
a
strategy
known
as
the
``
oil
plan
''
.
by
early
<year>
,
rostow
had
finally
won
over
general
carl
spaatz
to
the
merits
of
the
``
oil
plan
''
.
in
early
<year>
,
there
was
much
debate
about
the
merits
of
the
``
oil
plan
''
vs.
the
``
transportation
plan
''
of
targeting
the
german
and
french
railroad
system.
the
``
transportation
plan
''
was
implemented
first
as
part
of
the
run-up
to
operation
overlord.
the
``
oil
plan
''
began
to
be
implemented
as
a
strategy
by
the
army
air
force
in
may
<year>
,
which
rostow
later
called
a
disastrous
error
,
claiming
if
the
``
oil
plan
''
had
been
adopted
earlier
,
the
war
would
have
been
won
far
earlier.
he
also
claimed
that
the
united
states
would
have
entered
into
the
cold
war
in
a
far
stronger
position
as
he
always
maintained
that
if
``
oil
plan
''
had
been
adopted
earlier
it
would
have
allowed
the
u.s.
army
to
push
deeper
into
central
europe
and
even
into
eastern
europe.
based
on
his
world
war
ii
experiences
,
rostow
became
a
convinced
advocate
of
strategical
bombing
,
arguing
that
it
was
the
bombing
campaign
against
germany
's
cities
that
had
won
the
war.
for
his
work
with
the
enemy
objectives
unit
during
the

,
rostow
was
awarded
an
obe.in
<year>
,
immediately
after
the

,
rostow
became
assistant
chief
of
the
german-austrian
economic
division
in
the
united

department
of
state
in
washington
,
d.c.
rostow
was
invited
to
part
in

strategic

survey
(
ussbs
)
,
an
assessment
of
the
effects
of
the
strategical
bombing
campaign
on
germany
's
economy
,
but
he
declined.
several
of
rostow
's
future
foes
in
the
<year>s
such
as
george
ball
,
john
kenneth
galbraith
and
arthur
m.
schlesinger
jr.
did
take
part
in
the
ussbs
,
and
came
away
convinced
that
the
strategical
bombing
campaign
did
not
cripple
the
german
economy
as
its
advocates
had
promised
,
an
experience
that
led
these

to
doubt
the
efficacy
of
bombing
north
vietnam.
through
the
``
oil
plan
''
did
indeed
work
as
rostow
had
promised
,
those
taking
part
in
the
ussbs
also
noted
that
german
industrial
production
peaked
in
december
<year>
,
which
led
them
to
doubt
the
effects
of
strategical
bombing
as
a
way
of
breaking
a
nation
's
economy.
in
<year>
,
he
returned
to
oxford
as
the
harold
vyvyan
harmsworth
professor
of
american
history.
in
<year>
,
he
became
the
assistant
to
the
executive
secretary
of
the
economic
commission
for
europe
,
and
was
involved
in
the
development
of
the
marshall
plan.
one
of
rostow
's
colleagues
recalled
:
``
in
early
<year>
,
walt
rostow
had
a
revelation
that
the
unity
of
germany
could
not
be
achieved
without
the
unity
of
europe
,
and
that
the
unity
of
europe
could
best
be
approached
crabwise
through
technical
cooperation
in
economic
matters
,
rather
than
bluntly
in
diplomatic
negotiations
''
.
rostow
's
writings
on
the
subject
of
european
economic
unity
attracted
the
attention
of
undersecretary
of
state
dean
acheson
,
and
ultimately
jean
monnet
,
the
french
diplomat
regarded
as
the
``
father
''
of
the
european
coal
and
steel
community
of
<year>
that
became
the
european
economic
community
in
<year>.rostow
spent
a
year
at
cambridge
university
as
the
pitt
professor
of
american
history
and
institutions.
he
was
professor
of
economic
history
at
the
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
(
mit
)
from
<year>
to
<year>
,
and
a
staff
member
at
the
center
for
international
studies
(
cis
)
at
the
mit
from
<year>
to
<year>.
the
outbreak
of
the
korean
war
decisively
altered
rostow
's
thinking
about
the
soviet
union.
until
the
korean
war
,
rostow
had
believed
that
the
soviet
system
would
ultimately
``
mellow
''
on
its
own
accord
and
he
had
also
viewed
the
cold
war
as
a
largely
diplomatic
conflict
as
opposed
to
a
military
struggle.
the
north
korean
aggression
against
south
korea
convinced
him
that
the
cold
war
required
a
more
militarized
foreign
policy
as
he
called
for
greater
defense
spending
in
a
speech
in
the
fall
of
<year>
so
a
``
larger
full
mobilization
could
be
carried
out
quickly.
''
to
pay
for
the
higher
amount
of
defense
spending
,
rostow
urged
the
american
people
to
accept
the
need
for
a
``
very
high
level
of
taxation
appropriated
equally
''
.from
late
<year>
to
august
<year>
,
rostow
headed
the
soviet
vulnerabilities
project.
the
project
,
which
was
sponsored
by
the
cis
and
received
significant
support
from
the
u.s.
government
,
sought
to
identify
soviet
vulnerabilities
with
regard
to
political/psychological
warfare
,
and
it
received
contributions
from
top
sovietologist
and
psychological
warfare
specialists.
in
june
<year>
,
rostow
headed
a
group
of
stalwart
cold
warriors
who
were
called
the
quantico
vulnerabilities
panel
which
issued
a
report
that
advocated
nuclear
coercion
of
the
soviet
union.
although
the
experts
were
invited
by
nelson
rockefeller
,
their
proposal
ran
contrary
to
the
policy
of
the
eisenhower
administration.in
<year>
,
rostow
advised
president
dwight
eisenhower
on
economic
and
foreign
policy
,
and
in
<year>
he
became
a
speechwriter
for
him.
in
may
<year>
,
rostow
was
deeply
shocked
when
he
heard
of
the
french
defeat
at
the
battle
of
dien
bien
phu
,
expressing
his
disgust
that
french
leaders
had
failed
to
create
a
political
alignment
which
would
``
effectively
rally
the
vietnamese
against
the
communists
''
.
rostow
believed
the
communist
viet
minh
fighting
for
independence
from
france
were
a
small
,
radical
terrorist
minority
entirely
unrepresentative
of
the
vietnamese
people
,
the
majority
of
whom
he
believed
supported
the
french-dominated
,
but
nominally
independent
state
of
vietnam
created
in
<year>.
at
the
same
time
,
he
lashed
out
at
eisenhower
for
``
refusing
to
involve
american
units
in
combat
''
as
a
plan
had
been
drafted
code-named
operation
vulture
calling
for
the
american
intervention
in
vietnam
with
tactical
nuclear
weapons.
eisenhower
had
operation
vulture
contingent
upon
british
involvement
,
and
when
the
british
predictably
refused
to
become
involved
,
used
that
as
an
excuse
not
to
execute
operation
vulture.
in
august
<year>
,
rostow
and
fellow
cia-connected
mit
economics
professor
max
f.
millikan
convinced
eisenhower
to
massively
increase
us
foreign
aid
for
development
as
part
of
a
policy
of
spreading
what
he
saw
as
``
american-style
''
economic
growth
in
asia
and
elsewhere
,
backed
by
the
military.
unlike
many
of
the
first
generation
of
``
cold
warriors
''
who
saw
the
cold
war
in
essentially
euro-centric
terms
,
rostow
viewed
the
cold
war
as
a
global
struggle
in
which
the
third
world
was
its
most
important
battlefield.
rostow
often
accused
people
such
as
george
f.
kennan
and
dean
acheson
of
being
racists
because
they
viewed
europe
as
being
far
more
important
than
asia.
on
<day>
,
rostow
first
met
senator
john
f.
kennedy
,
who
was
impressed
with
the
academic
who
understood
power.
on
<day>
,
rostow
appeared
as
a
witness
before
the
senate
foreign
relations
committee
,
where
as
prearranged
,
kennedy
asked
him
a
question
about
american
economic
aid
to
india
,
which
led
to
the
reply
the
``
present
aid
program
,
which
amounts
to
about
$
<integer>
million
this
year
,
is
grossly
inadequate
''
.
the
purpose
of
the
testimony
was
to
embarrass
eisenhower
whom
both
men
believed
was
neglecting
the
third
world.
rostow
wrote
two
speeches
for
kennedy
,
which
he
delivered
on
the
senate
floor
,
attacking
the
eisenhower
administration
for
ignoring
india
,
while
the
soviet
union
was
not
,
and
led
ultimately
india
being
granted
$
<integer>
million
in
exchange
credits
from
the
import-export
bank
later
that
year.
in
september
<year>
,
rostow
left
to
take
a
professorship
at
cambridge
university
,
where
he
started
writing
his
magnum
opus
,
a
book
intended
to
debunk
marxism
as
a
theory
that
became
the
stages
of
economic
growth.
at
a
time
when
nikita
khrushchev
was
boasting
that
the
soviet
union
with
its
five
year
plans
would
soon
surpass
the
united
states
as
the
world
's
dominant
economic
power
because
what
he
interpreted
as
marxist
theory
explained
both
the
past
and
the
future
,
there
was
much
desire
in
the
american
political
and
intellectual
establishments
to
assess
its
ideological
dimensions.
==
the
stages
of
economic
growth
==
in
<year>
,
rostow
published
the
stages
of
economic
growth
:
a
non-communist
manifesto
,
which
proposed
the
rostovian
take-off
model
of
economic
growth
,
one
of
the
major
historical
models
of
economic
growth
,
which
argues
that
economic
modernization
occurs
in
five
basic
stages
of
varying
length
:
traditional
society
,
preconditions
for
take-off
,
take-off
,
drive
to
maturity
,
and
high
mass
consumption.
this
became
one
of
the
important
concepts
in
the
theory
of
modernization
in
social
evolutionism.
a
product
of
its
time
and
place
,
the
book
argued
that
one
of
the
central
problems
of
the
cold
war
as
understood
by
american
decision-makers
,
namely
that
there
were
millions
of
people
living
in
poverty
in
the
third
world
whom
communism
appealed
to
,
could
be
solved
by
a
policy
of
modernization
to
be
fostered
by
american
economic
aid
and
growth.
rostow
began
the
book
with
the
question
about
where
the
world
was
going
,
asking
``
is
it
taking
us
to
communism
,
or
the
affluent
suburbs
,
nicely
rounded
out
with
social
overhead
capital
;
to
destruction
;
to
the
moon
;
or
where
?
''
using
the
industrial
revolution
in
britain
as
his
case
study
,
rostow
sought
to
rebut
karl
marx
's
construction
of
history
,
arguing
that
marx
's
reading
of
british
history
,
which
he
based
much
of
his
theories
upon
,
was
defective.
the
book
was
essentially
a
call
for
greater
american
involvement
in
the
third
world
as
rostow
wrote
that
much
of
the
third
world
was
struck
in
the
``
traditional
stage
''
or
``
preconditions
for
take-off
''
stage
,
but
with
a
little
help
from
the
us
could
reach
the
``
take-off
''
stage.
the
stages
concluded
:
``
we
must
demonstrate
that
the
underdeveloped
nations
...
can
move
successfully
through
the
preconditions
into
a
well
established
take-off
within
the
orbit
of
the
democratic
world
,
resisting
the
blandishments
and
temptations
of
communism.
this
is
,
i
believe
,
the
most
important
item
on
the
western
agenda.
''
.guy
ortolano
argues
that
as
an
alternative
to
marxist
class-oriented
analysis
rostow
replaced
class
with
nation
as
the
agent
of
history.
british
history
then
became
the
base
for
comparisons.
however
rostow
never
explicitly
offered
the
british
case
as
the
ideal
model
for
nations
to
copy.
many
commentators
assumed
that
was
his
goal
and
attention
turned
to
issues
of
american
exceptionalism
,
and
the
argument
that
britain
created
the
modern
economy.rostow
's
thesis
was
criticized
at
the
time
and
subsequently
as
universalizing
a
model
of
western
development
that
could
not
be
replicated
in
places
like
latin
america
or
sub-saharan
africa.
another
line
of
criticism
was
his
thesis
that
societies
based
upon
``
mass
production
''
and
``
mass
consumption

much
of

like
the
various
theories
of
marxism
that
he
had
hoped
to
debunk
,
rostow
offered
up
a
grand
theory
,
in
this
case
,
the
``
modernization
theory
''
that
explained
the
past
and
predicted
the

as
rostow
asserted
that
capitalism
was
inevitably
destined
to
triumph
because
,
in
his
view
,
it
was
the

system.
the
american

wrote
about
the

as
``

much
interest

was
expressed
by
both
economists

policy-makers.
rostow
's
concept
of
``

''
especially
appealed
to
the
south

general
park

impressed
presidential
candidate
john
f.
kennedy
,
who
appointed
rostow
as
one
of
his
political
advisers
,
and
sought
his
advice.
after
attempting
unsuccessfully
to
be
appointed
to
a
major
post
under
the
eisenhower
administration
,
rostow
decided
to
try
his
luck
with
kennedy
in
<year>.
during
the
<year>
election
,
rostow
served
as
a
speech-writer
and
adviser
for
the
kennedy
campaign
,
where
he
became
known
as
an
``
effervescent

.
rostow
wrote
the
speech
calling
for
a
``

''
,
which
kennedy
gave
when
he
won
the
democratic
nomination.
the
favorable
reception
to
the
``
new
frontier
''
speech
led
kennedy
to
promise
rostow
a
senior
position
if
he
won
the
election.
rostow
also
coined
the
slogan
of
kennedy
's
<year>
campaign
``
let
's
get
the
country
moving
again
''
.
initially
,
kennedy
wanted
to
give
rostow
a
major
post
in
his
administration.
after
rostow
wrote
a
policy
paper
in
december
<year>
to
outline
the
incoming
kennedy
administration
's
``
flexible
response
''
nuclear
posture
to
replace
the
eisenhower
administration
's
``

doctrine
,
in
which
he
stressed
that

be
willing
to
use

in
southeast

to
counter

the
man
whom
kennedy
nominated
to
serve
as
his
secretary
of
state
dean
rusk
,
vetoed
rostow
's
appointment.when
kennedy
became
president
in
<year>
,
he
appointed
rostow
as
deputy
to
his
national
security
assistant
mcgeorge
bundy.
through
rostow
was
just
bundy
's
deputy
,
in
practice
he
served
as
an
equal
as
initially
kennedy
was
greatly
influenced
by
the
advice
he
received
from
the
renowned
,
world
famous
economist.
just
before
kennedy
was
inaugurated
as
president
on
<day>
,
on
<day>
,
the
soviet
leader
,
nikita
khrushchev
delivered
a
speech
in
moscow
declaring
that
the
soviet
union
was
allegedly
able
and
willing
to
support
any
``
war
of
national
liberation
''
anywhere
in
the
third
world.
khrushchev
's
speech
was
largely
a
response
to
the
sino-soviet
split
of
<year>
as
mao
zedong
had
accused
khrushchev
of
``
revisionism
''
and
denounced
the
soviet
union
for
not
supporting
third
world
anti-colonial
and
nationalist
movements.
as
such
,
mao
announced
that
he
regarded
himself
as
the
proper
leader
of
the
world
communist
movement
,
causing
khrushchev
to
strike
back
with
his
speech
in
moscow
announcing
his
willingness
to
support
``
wars
of
national
liberation
''
.
missing
the
context
of
sino-soviet
rivalry
,
kennedy
and
his
advisers
regarded
khrushchev
's
speech
as
a
bold
new
soviet
gambit
for
world
domination
,
making
the
subject
of
the
third
world
a
key
concern
for
him.
the
first
meeting
of
the
national
security
council
under
kennedy
on
<day>
was
entirely
devoted
to
the
subject
of
the
third
world
with
the
president
reading
out
excerpts
of
khrushchev
's
``
wars
of
national
liberation
speech
''
to
underline
the
danger.
rostow
,
who
always
saw
the
third
world
as
the
main
``
battlefield
''
of
the
cold
war
,
enjoyed
much
influence
with
the
new
president
at
first.
as
the
apostle
of
the
modernization
theory
,
rostow
laid
out
policies
to
counter
communism
in
the
third
world.
rostow
supported
the
bay
of
pigs
invasion
,
albeit
with
reservations
,
arguing
the
existence
of
a
communist
government
in
cuba
was
unacceptable
as
otherwise
the
rest
of
latin
america
might
be
``
infected
''
with
communism.
along
the
same
lines
,
rostow
was
the
main
inspiration
for
the
alliance
for
progress
,
a
$
<integer>
billion
aid
program
for
latin
america
launched
with
great
fanfare
by
kennedy
in
<year>
who
in
a
speech
written
by
rostow
spoke
of
how
the
alliance
for
progress
would
allow
latin
america
to
reach
the
``
economic
take-off
''
stage
of
growth
by
having
an
annual
growth
rate
of
<decimal>
%
(
a
target
chosen
by
rostow
)
,
which
would
end
the
appeal
of
communism
in
latin
america
forever.
rostow
was
also
instrumental
in
persuading
kennedy
that
the
best
way
to
fight
communism
in
the
third
world
in
general
,
not
just
latin
america
,
was
to
increase
aid
,
and
in
<year>
american
aid
to
the
rest
of
the
third
world
went
up
to
$
<decimal>
billion
from
$
<decimal>
billion
in
<year>.
in
a
speech
written
by
rostow
,
kennedy
announced
that
the
<year>s
would
be
the
``
decade
of
development
''
,
saying
that
the
united
states
was
willing
and
able
to
furnish
sufficient
foreign
aid
to
allow
the
third
world
nations
to
reach
the
``
economic
take-off
''
stage.rostow
annoyed
kennedy
as
an
``
idea-a-minute
man
''
,
causing
him
to
complain
that
rostow
had
too
many
ideas
for
his
own
good
and
was
unable
to
focus
on
what
was
really
important.
kennedy
's
main
complaint
was
that
rostow
would
in
a
rapid-fire
fashion
offer
up
a
deluge
of
ideas
,
which
made
him
hard
to
follow.
kennedy
had
come
into
the
white
house
in
january
<year>
as
a
confirmed
hawk
,
who
during
the
<year>
election
had
criticized
eisenhower
as
``
soft
on
communism
''
for
not
overthrowing
fidel
castro
,
but
the
disaster
of
the
bay
of
pigs
invasion
in
april
had
cooled
his
martial
ardor.
after
the
bay
of
pigs
invasion
,
he
came
to
distrust
the
hawkish
advice
he
received
from
the
cia
and
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff.
as
a
result
,
kennedy
also
rejected
the
hawkish
advice
he
received
from
rostow
,
charging
the
experts
had
all
told
him
that
the
bay
of
pigs
invasion
could
not
possibly
fail.
just
after
the
bay
of
pigs
invasion
,
kennedy
rejected
advice
from
rostow
to
send
u.s.
troops
to
laos.
the
economist
john
kenneth
galbraith
advised
his
friend
kennedy
that
laos
was
not
worth
a
war
,
and
kennedy
himself
noted
to
supply
forces
in
laos
would
present
severe
logistical
problems.
finally
remembering
how
the
approach
of
american
forces
upon
the
yalu
river
led
to
chinese
intervention
in
the
korean
war
,
the
president
was
concerned
that
intervening
in
laos
would
cause
a
war
with
china
that
he
did
not
want.
instead
,
kennedy
sent
the
diplomat
w.
averell
harriman
to
negotiate
an
agreement
to
``
neutralize
''
laos
,
which
marked
the
beginning
of
the
feud
between
rostow
and
harriman
as
the
former
started
to
see
the
latter
as
an
appeaser.kennedy
also
charged
that
rostow
was
too
fixated
on
vietnam
,
saying
he
seemed
to
have
an
obsession
with
that
country
as
he
spent
much
time
talking
about
vietnam.
rostow
believed
in
the
``
domino
theory
''
,
predicating
that
if
south
vietnam
fell
,
the
rest
of
southeast
asia
would
also
fall
like
so
many
dominoes
,
and
ultimately
india
would
fall
as
well.
as
early
as
june
<year>
,
rostow
was
advising
kennedy
to
bomb
north
vietnam.
during
the
berlin
crisis
of
<year>
,
rostow
advised
kennedy
:
``
we
must
find
ways
of
putting
pressure
on
khrushchev
's
side
of
the
line
with
conventional
forces
or
other
means
...
we
must
begin
now
to
present
khrushchev
with
the
risk
that
if
he
heightens
the
berlin
crisis
,
we
and
the
west
germans
may
take
action
that
will
cause
east
germany
to
come
unstruck
''
.
the
particular
action
that
rostow
advised
kennedy
to
take
was
to
``
take
and
hold
a
piece
of
territory
in
east
germany
that
khrushchev
may
not
wish
to
lose
(
for
example
,
magdeburg
)
''
.
kennedy
rejected
this
advice
as
too
dangerous
,
stating
that
having
u.s
forces
seize
part
of
east
germany
would
almost
certainly
cause
a
nuclear
war
with
the
soviet
union.
later
that
year
,
rostow
became
director
of
the
state
department
's
policy
planning
staff.
at
the
time
,
kennedy
commented
:
``
walt
is
a
fountain
of
ideas
;
perhaps
one
in
ten
of
them
is
absolutely
brilliant.
unfortunately
six
or
seven
are
not
merely
unsound
,
but
dangerously
so.
i
admire
his
creativity
,
but
it
will
be
more
comfortable
to
have
him
creating
at
some
remove
from
the
white
house
''
.kennedy
told
rostow
that
his
being
demoted
from
the
white
house
to
the
state
department
was
because
:
``
over
here
in
the
white
house
we
have
to
play
with
a
very
narrow
range
of
choices
...
we
ca
n't
do
long-range
planning
;
it
has
to
be
done
over
there.
i
want
you
to
go
over
there
and
catch
hold
of
the
process
at
the
level
where
it
counts
''
.
appealing
to
kennedy
's
catholicism
,
rostow
complained
that
:
``
i
am
going
from
being
a
priest
in
rome
to
being
a
bishop
in
the
provinces.
''
in
october
<year>
,
rostow
went
on
a
fact-finding
mission
with
general
maxwell
taylor
to
south
vietnam
and
he
returned
full
of
enthusiasm
for
greater
american
involvement
in
what
he
stated
``
might
be
the
last
great
confrontation
''
with
communism.
the
report
that
taylor
and
rostow
wrote
advocated
that
kennedy
sent
between
<integer>
,
<integer>
and
<integer>
,
<integer>
u.s
army
troops
to
fight
in
south
vietnam
under
the
guise
of
being
``
flood
relief
workers
''
.
kennedy
rejected
the
taylor-rostow
report
's
recommendation
that
he
sent
troops
to
fight
in
south
vietnam
,
but
accepted
the
report
's
other
recommendations
calling
for
more
military
and
economic
aid
to
south
vietnam.
karnow
described
rostow
as
a
man
who
``
seemed
to
revel
in
the
war
''
as
it
appeared
that
he
wanted
to
prove
that
a
short
,
bald
,
bespectacled
new
york
intellectual
could
be
just
as
hard
,
tough
and
macho
as
the
idealized
world
war
ii
veteran
that
hollywood
kept
portraying
in
action
films
at
the
time.
rostow
had
served
in
world
war
ii
as
an
intelligence
analysis
with
the
task
of
selecting
bombing
targets
in
germany
,
an
important
,
but
comfortable
``
desk
job
''
that
ensured
he
never
saw
combat
,
a
point
about
which
he
was
very
sensitive.in
february
<year>
,
president
ngo
dinh
diem
introduced
the
strategic
hamlet
program
of
forcibly
relocating
peasants
to
strategic
hamlets
as
a
way
of
severing
the
population
from
the
viet
cong
guerrillas.
though
impetus
for
the
strategic
hamlet
program
came
from
diem
,
rostow
supported
the
program
as
a
way
of
breaking
down
the
``
traditional
person
''
,
arguing
that
the
strategic
hamlets
would
be
agents
of
modernization.
he
remained
baffled
as
to
why
the
strategic
hamlets
were
so
unpopular
with
south
vietnamese
peasants.
in
<year>
,
rostow
drafted
the
statement
of
basic
national
security
policy
(
bnsp
)
,
a
<integer>-page
document
meant
to
outline
the
foreign
policy
of
the
kennedy
administration.
reflecting
his
interest
in
the
modernization
theory
,
rostow
identified
the
third
world
,
especially
``
the
arc
from
iran
to
korea
''
as
the
most
important
``
battlefield
''
of
the
cold
war.
through
to
some
extent
based
upon
the
theory
of
``
containment
''
as
argued
by
george
f.
kennan
in
the
<year>s
,
rostow
's
bnsp
argued
for
the
united
states
to
promote
economic
growth
in
the
third
world
and
for
the
creation
of
``
a
wider
community
of
free
nations
,
embracing
latin
america
,
africa
,
asia
and
the
middle
east
''
.
kennan
who
was
serving
as
the
us
ambassador
in
belgrade
at
the
time
reviewed
the
bnsp
vigorously
criticized
the
document.
kennan
attacked
rostow
's
advocacy
of
a
winnable
nuclear
war
,
writing
he
would
``
rather
see
my
children
dead
''
than
live
in
a
world
devastated
by
nuclear
war.
kennan
also
criticized
rostow
's
optimism
about
process
in
the
third
world
,
writing
that
the
third
world
was
hopelessly
backward
and
might
be
a
danger
to
the
us
if
allowed
to
process.
however
,
some
of
the
statements
in
kennan
's
critique
,
where
he
argued
that
a
first
world
standard
of
living
was
``
peculiar
to
peoples
who
have
had
their
origins
on
or
near
the
shores
of
the
north
sea
''
or
to
nations
descended
from
such
peoples
like
the
united
states
allowed
rostow
to
accuse
kennan
with
some
justification
of
racism.during
the
cuban
missile
crisis
,
rostow
was
mostly
excluded
from
the
decision-making
process
,
having
only
meeting
with
kennedy
during
the
crisis
where
he
advised
him
to
stop
soviet
ships
carrying
oil
to
cuba
,
advice
that
was
not
taken.
unaware
that
kennedy
had
promised
not
to
invade
cuba
and
to
pull
american
missiles
out
of
turkey
as
part
of
the
resolution
,
rostow
saw
the
cuban
missile
crisis
as
a
triumph
,
which
proved
the
superior
power
of
the
united
states.
inspired
by
the
cuban
missile
crisis
,
rostow
on
<day>
called
in
a
memo
for
the

,
writing
:
``
the
whole
lesson
of
the
cold
war
including
the
recent
cuba
crisis
is
that
communists
do
not
escalate
in
response
to
our
actions
''
.
in
<year>
,
rostow
started
to
advocate
what
became
known
in
washington
as
the
``
rostow
thesis
''
,
namely
if
the
united
states
bombed
north
vietnam
along
the
same
lines
that
germany
and
japan
were
bombed
in
world
war
ii
,
then
the
north
vietnamese
would
have
to
cease
trying
to
overthrow
the
government
of
south
vietnam.in
<year>
,
rostow
first
advocated
invading
north
vietnam
,
arguing
for
american
and
south
vietnamese
landings
on
the
coast
of
north
vietnam
as
the
prelude
for
reuniting
vietnam
under
the
saigon
government.
in
a
policy
paper
addressed
to
the
assistant
secretary
of
state
for
asian
affairs
,
w.
averell
harriman
,
dated
<day>
,
that
began
with
the
sentence
:
``
before
you
decide
your
old
and
respectful
friend
has
gone
off
his
rocker
...
''
,
rostow
advocated
invading
north
vietnam.
as
the
approach
of
u.s.
troops
to
the
yalu
river
in
<year>
led
to
the
chinese
intervention
in
the
korean
war
,
it
was
generally
accepted
within
washington
that
invading
north
vietnam
would
likewise
lead
to
a
war
with
china.
for
this
reason
,
harriman
was
not
impressed
with
rostow
's
paper
and
advised
kennedy
to
send
rostow
back
to
his
perch
in
academia
,
saying
that
rostow
was
far
too
blasé
about
the
possibility
of
a
nuclear
war
with
china.
the
chinese
nuclear
program
was
well
advanced
by
<year>
,
and
in
<year>
china
exploded
its
first
atomic
bomb
,
followed
by
its
first
hydrogen
bomb
in
<year>.
rostow
underlined
this
consideration
in
paper
addressed
in
july
<year>
,
stating
it
would
be
best
to
invade
north
vietnam
before
the
chinese
``
blow
a
nuclear
device
''
.
harriman
was
one
of
the
richest
men
in
the
united
states
,
who
was
very
generous
in
donating
to
the
democratic
party
,
and
as
such
served
as
a
friend
and
adviser
to
every
democratic
president
from
roosevelt
to
johnson.
the
persistence
which
rostow
advocated
invading
north
vietnam
even
after
the
first
chinese
nuclear
test
in
<year>
worried
harriman
,
and
he
consistently
sought
to
club
rostow
's
influence
,
making
him
into
one
of
rostow
's
main
enemies
in
washington.after
kennedy
's
assassination
,
his
successor
lyndon
b.
johnson
promoted
rostow
to
bundy
's
job
after
he
wrote
johnson
's
first
state
of
the
union
speech.
kennedy
had
generally
ignored
rostow
's
advice
,
but
johnson
started
to
pay
attention
to
him
after
he
wrote
a
paper
in
february
<year>
stating
a
strategic
bombing
campaign
against
north
vietnam
would
be
enough
to
win
the
war.
when
the
american
ambassador
to
laos
,
william
h.
sullivan
,
wrote
in
february
<year>
he
did
not
believe
a
strategic
bombing
would
be
decisive
as
the
viet
cong
had
a
``
sustaining
strength
of
their
own
''
,
rostow
was
ferocious
,
arguing
the
viet
cong
had
no
real
basis
of
support
in
south
vietnam
and
only
existed
because
north
vietnam
was
supporting
them.
the
idea
that
communism
had
an
appeal
to
least
some
of
south
vietnam
's
people
was
anathema
to
rostow
,
who
insisted
that
there
was
no
civil
war
in
south
vietnam
and
there
was
only
a
struggle
between
north
vietnam
vs.
south
vietnam.
the
papers
rostow
wrote
urged
a
policy
of
``
graduated
''
pressure
as
the
united
states
would
steadily
increase
the
level
of
bombing
to
such
a
point
that
it
would
ultimately
lead
to
the
destruction
of
north
vietnam
's
nascent
industry.
unlike
most
american
decision-makers
,
who
knew
nothing
of
vietnam
's
history
,
rostow
had
done
much
reading
on
the
subject
,
and
had
learned
that
over
the
centuries
that
chinese
elites
considered
vietnam
a
lost
province
which
they
would
one
day
reclaim
(
vietnam
had
been
a
chinese
province
from
<integer>
bc
to
<integer>
ad
)
,
leading
to
a
long
series
of
vietnamese-chinese
wars
as
successive
vietnamese
emperors
fought
off
attempts
by
the
emperors
of
china
to
incorporate
vietnam
into
the
middle
kingdom.
knowing
of
the
full
depth
of
the
sino-vietnamese
enmity
,
rostow
reached
the
conclusion
that
ho
chi
minh
would
not
want
his
nation
to
draw
too
close
to
china
,
and
as
such
,
could
not
risk
the
destruction
of
north
vietnam
's
industry
,
which
would
leave
north
vietnam
entirely
dependent
upon
china.
one
of
rostow
's
opponents
,
george
ball
,
argued
that
ho
's
vietnamese
nationalism
would
make
him
an
asian
version
of
josip
broz
tito
of
yugoslavia
,
a
communist
leader
who
wanted
his
nation
to
be
independent
of
both
moscow
and
beijing.
ball
argued
that
south
vietnam
was
a
poor
and
politically
unstable
ally
that
contributed
little
to
american
national
security
,
and
allowing
ho
to
reunify
vietnam
would
pose
no
danger
to
the
united
states.
rostow
,
by
contrast
,
argued
that
south
vietnam
was
the
crucial
to
american
national
security
and
to
allow
the
first
``
domino
''
to
fall
would
cause
the
other
``
dominoes
''
in
southeast
asia
;
in
his
mind
,
losing
any
nation
to
communism
,
even
it
was
of
the
titoist
type
was
unacceptable.starting
in
february
<year>
,
rostow
championed
the
idea
of
congress
giving
president
johnson
the
power
to
wage
war
in
southeast
asia
,
an
idea
that
he
first
suggested
in
february
<year>.
rostow
pointed
out
in
a
memo
to
the
president
that
the
degree
of
escalation
in
the
vietnam
war
envisioned
by
the
administration
would
pose
constitutional
and
legal
problems
as
the
constitution
gave
congress
,
not
the
president
,
the
right
to
declare
war
and
the
level
of
escalation
envisioned
would
be
a
war
in
everything
,
but
name.
rostow
'
solution
to
this
problem
was
for
congress
to
pass
a
resolution
giving
the
president
the
legal
power
to
essentially
wage
a
war
in
vietnam.when
congress
passed
the
gulf
of
tonkin
resolution
on
<day>
,
which
was
the
closest
thing
to
a
declaration
of
war
that
the
united
states
had
in
vietnam
,
rostow
was
well
pleased.
about
the
gulf
of
tonkin
incident
that
led
to
the
resolution
,
rostow
later
said
:
``
we
do
n't
know
what
happened
,
but
it
had
the
desired
effect
''
.
in
november
<year>
,
rostow
advised
johnson
to
commit
u.s.
ground
forces
to
vietnam
to
prove
that
``
we
are
prepared
to
face
down
any
form
of
escalation
''
and
to
send
``
massive
''
naval
and
air
forces
to
strike
north
vietnam
and
if
necessary
,
china
as
well.
in
a
memo
to
johnson
,
rostow
wrote
:
``
they
[
the
vietnamese
communists
]
will
not
actually
accept
a
setback
until
they
are
sure
that
we
mean
it
''
and
needed
to
know
that
``
they
now
confront
a
lbj
who
has
made
up
his
mind
''
.in
the
<year>
election
,
the
republican
candidate
,
senator
barry
goldwater
,
ran
on
a
platform
promising
an
aggressive
foreign
policy
that
would
achieve
a
``
total
victory
''
over
communism
(
by
which
goldwater
presumably
meant
the
soviet
union
and
china
)
.
by
contrast
,
johnson
sought
to
portray
himself
as
just
as
``
tough
on
communism
''
as
goldwater
while
also
portraying
his
opponent
as
a
right-wing
extremist
who
was
likely
to
cause
a
nuclear
war.
the
republican
slogan
``
in
your
heart
you
know
he
's
right
''
was
mercilessly
lampooned
by
the
democrats
with
the
counter-slogan
``
in
your
guts
you
know
he
's
nuts
!
''
in
the
context
of
the
<year>
election
,
johnson
found
the
idea
of
a
gradual
process
of
escalating
american
involvement
in
vietnam
appealing
as
it
allowed
him
to
present
both
as
a
``
tough
''
president
while
also
less
extreme
than
goldwater.
rostow
's
consistent
advocacy
of
a
strategic
bombing
against
north
vietnam
as
the
decisive
way
to
win
the
war
endeared
him
to
johnson
as
it
promised
a
``
cheap
''
victory
that
would
not
cost
too
many
american
lives.
the
national
security
adviser
johnson
had
inherited
from
kennedy
,
mcgeorge
bundy
,
greatly
annoyed
the
president
as
he
spoke
with
an
upper-class
new
england
accent
that
johnson
found
patronizing.
when
bundy
developed
doubts
about
the
vietnam
war
in
early
<year>
,
johnson
sacked
him.
==
national
security
advisor
==
as
national
security
advisor
,
rostow
was
responsible
for
developing
the
government
's
policy
in
vietnam
,
and
was
convinced
that
the
war
could
be
won
,
becoming
johnson
's
main
war
hawk
and
playing
an
important
role
in
bringing
johnson
's
presidency
to
an
end.
rostow
was
extremely
close
to
johnson
,
later
recalling
:
:johnson
took
me
into
his
house
as
well
as
his
staff
,
into
his
family
;
took
my
family
in
as
well.
it
was
an
open-hearted
,
human
relationship.
i
came
to
hold
the
greatest
possible
affection
for
him
,
love
for
him
,
as
well
as
respect
for
the
job.
i
had
an
enormous
compassion
for
what
he
was
bearing
during
those
years
,
for
what
the
family
was
bearing.
at
the
time
the
appointment
of
rostow
as
national
security
advisor
was
well
received
with
almost
all
of
the
american
media
praising
johnson
for
appointing
such
an
eminent
economist
and
historian
to
advise
him.
in
an
editorial
the
new
york
times
wrote
that
rostow
was
:
a
scholar
with
an
original
mind
as
well
as
an
experienced
official
and
policy
planner
...
one
of
the
architects
of
john
f.
kennedy
's
foreign
policy
...
mr.
rostow
,
of
course
,
will
be
only
one
of
the
president
's
principal
advisers
,
and
mr.
johnson
will
make
his
own
decisions.
but
the
appointment
places
beside
the
president
an
independent
and
cultivated
mind
that
,
as
in
the
bundy
era
,
should
assure
comprehension
both
of
the
intricacies
of
world
problems
and
of
the
options
among
which
the
white
house
must
choose.
no
president
could
ask
for
more.
johnson
stated
at
the
time
that
:
``
i
'm
getting
walt
rostow
as
my
intellectual.
he
's
not
your
intellectual.
he
's
not
bundy
's
intellectual.
he
's
not
schlesinger
's
intellectual.
he
's
not
galbraith
's
intellectual.
he
's
going
to
be
my
goddamn
intellectual
!
''
johnson
because
of
his
origins
as
a
man
from
the
impoverished
,
harsh
world
of
texas
who
spoke
his
english
with
a
heavy
texas
twang
and
who
had
rather
crude
manners
always
felt
a
certain
sense
of
inferiority
when
dealing
with
patrician
ivy
league
intellectuals
like
mcgeorge
bundy
,
arthur
schlesinger
and
john
kenneth
galbraith
,
who
all
served
under
kennedy.
kennedy
and
his
closest
advisers
always
regarded
johnson
as
``
white
trash
''
from
texas
,
a
vulgar
man
whose
company
had
to
be
endured
rather
than
enjoyed.
johnson
felt
that
rostow
's
status
as
a
jewish
intellectual
from
new
york
who
likewise
worked
his
way
up
from
poverty
made
him
into
a
kindred
soul
in
a
way
that
``
kennedy
's
intellectuals
''
never
could
be
for
him.
one
of
johnson
's
favorite
advisers
,
jack
valenti
,
recommended
rostow
to
the
president.johnson
's
background
growing
up
poor
on
a
farm
in
texas
left
him
with
a
sympathy
for
the
underprivileged
,
and
he
was
very
interested
in
rostow
's
plans
for
third
world
development.
rostow
later
recalled
about
johnson
:
``
he
was
always
for
the
underdog
''
.
through
johnson
believed
that
africa
was
a
hopeless
disaster
,
he
had
great
hopes
for
developing
latin
america
and
asia
,
remembering
how
the
new
deal
infrastructure
projects
of
the
<year>s
had
transformed
texas
,
until
then
a
very
backward
state.
as
rostow
's
specialization
was
the
subject
of
the
economic
modernization
of
the
third
world
,
his
area
of
expertise
appealed
to
the
president
,
who
often
talked
grandly
of
his
plans
to
bring
electricity
to
the
rural
areas
of
south
vietnam
as
the
necessary
prelude
to
ending
poverty
in
south
vietnam.
finally
,
rostow
's
consistently
optimistic
appraisal
of
the
vietnam
war
appealed
to
johnson
while
his
reputation
as
a
hardliner
was
meant
to
signal
that
johnson
was
prepared
to
do
whatever
it
took
to
win
the
war.
the
abrasive
johnson
,
who
was
notorious
within
washington
for
mistreating
his
staff
,
``
initiated
''
rostow
by
humiliating
him
by
first
leaking
news
of
his
appointment
to
the
press
,
and
then
calling
up
to
accuse
him
of
being
the
leak.
after
unleashing
a
torrent
of
obscurities
and
screaming
at
him
,
the
president
hung
up
the
phone
without
giving
rostow
a
chance
to
reply.
johnson
always
``
initiated
''
his
staff
by
humiliating
them
in
some
way
to
assert
his
dominance
,
and
rostow
seems
not
to
have
taken
it
personally.rostow
consistently
argued
to
johnson
that
any
effort
at
a
peaceful
resolution
to
the
vietnam
war
would
be
``
capitulation
''
.
in
his
reports
to
johnson
,
rostow
always
put
the
emphasis
on
information
that
portrayed
the
united
states
as
winning
,
becoming
johnson
's
favourite
adviser
on
foreign
affairs.
the
optimistic
reports
that
the
hawkish
rostow
wrote
were
much
preferred
by
the
president
to
the
more
pessimistic
reports
written
by
the
``
doves
''
in
the
administration.
a
typical
memo
from
rostow
on
<day>
read
:
``
mr.
president
,
you
can
smell
it
all
over.
hanoi
's
operation
,
backed
by
the
chicoms
[
chinese
communists
]
,
is
no
longer
being
regarded
as
the
wave
of
the
future
out
there.
u.s.
power
is
beginning
to
be
felt
''
.
the
ambassador-at-large
w.
averell
harriman
called
rostow
``
america
's
rasputin
''
as
he
considered
him
to
have
a
sinister
power
over
johnson
's
mind
,
as
he
always
pressed
the
president
to
take
a
harder
line
on
vietnam
against
the
advice
of
his
more
dovish
staff
,
harriman
included.
johnson
was
not
enthusiastic
about
the
vietnam
war
,
later
telling
his
biographer
doris
kearns
in
a
very
gendered
language
that
the
great
society
was
``
the
woman
i
really
loved
''
while
the
vietnam
war
was
``
that
bitch
of
a
war
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
''
.
as
a
president
,
johnson
had
often
in
private
complained
that
he
much
rather
focus
on
his
``
great
society
''
program
intended
to
end
poverty
and
racism
in
america
and
that
the
vietnam
war
was
an
unwanted
distraction.
given
these
views
,
harriman
found
it
mystifying
that
johnson
should
shun
his
advice
about
finding
a
way
for
the
united
states
to
gracefully
exit
vietnam
while
accepting
the
counsel
of
rostow.
johnson
remembered
how
the
``
loss
of
china
''
in
<year>
had
badly
damaged
the
democratic
administration
of
harry
s.
truman
who
was
excoriated
by
the
republicans
as
``
soft
on
communism
''
and
criminally
negligent
in
allowing
the
``
loss
of
china
''
,
attacks
that
resonated
with
the
american
people
at
the
time.
johnson
once
told
a
reporter
joseph
kraft
,
in
an
``
off-the-record
''
conversation
:
i
knew
that
harry
truman
and
dean
acheson
had
lost
their
effectiveness
from
the
day
the
communists
took
over
china.
i
believe
that
the
loss
of
china
had
played
a
large
role
in
the
rise
of
joe
mccarthy.
and
i
knew
that
all
these
problems
,
taken
together
,
were
chickenshit
compared
with
what
might
happen
if
we
lost
vietnam
...
i
do
n't
give
a
damn
about
these
little
pinkos
on
the
campuses
,
they
're
just
waving
their
diapers
and
bellyaching
because
they
do
n't
want
to
fight.
the
great
black
beast
for
us
is
the
right
wing.
if
we
do
n't
give
this
war
over
soon
they
'll
put
enormous
pressure
on
us
to
turn
it
into
an
armageddon
and
wreck
all
our
other
programs.
johnson
was
fearful
that
if
he
allowed
the
``
loss
of
vietnam
''
,
it
would
cause
a
similar
right-wing
backlash
that
would
allow
a
``
reactionary
''
republican
to
win
the
presidency
and
for
the
gop
to
take
control
of
congress
,
and
together
they
would
end
his
great
society
program
along
with
the
rest
of
johnson
's
civil
rights
legislation.
much
of
rostow
's
influence
on
johnson
was
due
to
his
insistence
that
to
protect
his
domestic
achievements
that
johnson
had
to
fight
the
vietnam
war
,
and
moreover
that
the
war
was
eminently
winnable
provided
that
the
correct
policies
were
followed.
for
johnson
,
rostow
offered
him
a
way
out
of
an
unpleasant
situation
of
fighting
a
war
in
vietnam
that
he
rather
not
fight
to
protect
the
great
society
by
promising
him
what
rostow
insisted
was
a
path
to
victory
,
as
rostow
noted
that
presidents
who
win
wars
were
usually
also
popular
presidents.in
particular
,
rostow
persistently
argued
to
the
president
that
a
programme
of
sustained
bombing
would
force
north
vietnam
to
cease
its
support
of
the
viet
cong
and
thus
win
the
war.
rostow
believed
that
strategic
bombing
alone
would
be
enough
to
force
north
vietnam
to
capitulate
,
and
became
the
main
advocate
in
the
white
house
of
operation
rolling
thunder
,
the
bombing
offensive
launched
against
north
vietnam
in
february
<year>.
initially
,
rostow
believed
in
only
bombing
certain
targets
as
a
way
of
warning
hanoi
to
cease
supporting
the
viet
cong
,
but
he
changed
his
mind
,
coming
to
favour
an
all-out
bombing
offensive
that
would
completely
destroy
the
economy
of
north
vietnam.
reflecting
the
lessons
of
the
oil
plan
,
rostow
in
particular
believed
that
the
destruction
of
the
north
vietnamese
oil
shortage
facilities
and
the
hydroelectric
grid
would
so
economically
cripple
north
vietnam
that
the
war
would
be
won
,
and
he
pressed
johnson
to
end
the
restrictions
on
bombing
oil
shortage
tanks
and
hydro
plants.
rostow
was
opposed
by
harriman
,
who
like
him
had
spent
much
of
world
war
ii
living
in
england
;
however
,
harriman
had
first-hand
observed
how
german
bombing
of
british
cities
had
hardened
the
will
of
the
british
public
,
and
he
now
argued
that
american
bombing
on
north
vietnam
was
having
the
same
effect
on
the
north
vietnamese
public.
the
fact
that
rostow
had
arrived
in
london
in
fall
of
<year>
,
when
the
worse
of
the
german
bombing
was
over
,
while
harriman
as
a
special
envoy
for
president
roosevelt
had
witnessed
first-hand
the
``
blitz
''
against
london
and
other
british
cities
in
the
winter
of
<year>–<integer>
contributed
to
their
differing
assessments
of
the
effects
of
bombing.
based
on
his
experiences
in
wartime
,
harriman
called
the
rostow
thesis
``
the
stick
without
the
carrot
''
.the
first
crisis
that
confronted
johnson
and
rostow
was
the
buddhist
uprising
in
south
vietnam
where
an
attempt
by
air
marshal
nguyễn
cao
kỳ
to
dismiss
general
nguyễn
chánh
thi
led
to
a
civil
war
within
the
civil
war
as
units
of
the
south
vietnamese
army
fought
one
another
,
much
to
the
consternation
of
johnson
who
could
not
believe
that
america
's
allies
in
south
vietnam
were
fighting
each
other.
rostow
for
his
part
advised
the
president
to
fully
support
kỳ
,
charging
that
the
buddhist
struggle
movement
which
had
rallied
behind
thi
was
being
used
by
the
communists.
rostow
told
johnson
:
``
we
are
faced
with
the
classic
revolutionary
situation-like
paris
in
<integer>
and
st.
petersburg
in
<year>
''
.
rostow
claimed
that
the
buddhists
were
just
being
used
by
the
viet
cong
just
as
lenin
used
kerensky
to
take
power
in
<year>
,
but
fortunately
american
forces
were
there
to
save
the
day.
rostow
concluded
:
``
in
the
face
of
defeat
in
the
field
and
kerensky
's
weaknesses
,
lenin
took
over
in
november.
this
is
about
what
would
happen
in
saigon
if
we
were
not
there
,
but
we
are
there
''
.
as
the
civil
war
within
the
civil
war
between
kỳ
and
thi
greatly
disturbed
johnson
,
rostow
's
advice
to
side
with
kỳ
was
decisive.
the
fact
that
kỳ
expressed
much
admiration
for
hitler
,
who
in
his
own
words
was
his
``
only
hero
''
apparently
did
not
offend
rostow.
one
of
rostow
's
aides
later
wrote
``
rostow
was
like
rasputin
to
a
tsar
under
siege
''
.
rostow
's
opponent
,
george
ball
wrote
about
rostow
's
influence
:
``
he
played
to
johnson
's
weaker
side
,
always
creating
an
image
of
johnson
standing
against
the
forces
of
evil.
he
used
to
tell
him
how
lincoln
was
abused
by
everybody
when
he
was
at
a
certain
stage
of
the
civil
war
...
he
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
creating
a
kind
of
fantasy
for
the
president
''
.
in
august
<year>
,
harriman
warned
rostow
against
escalating
the
war
to
the
brink
of
a
nuclear
war
with
china
to
best
preserve
life
on
plant
earth
,
only
to
be
told
``
it
is
only
in
extreme
crises
that
such
settlements
will
come
''
.at
one
point
in
<year>–<integer>
,
the
hawkish
rostow
advocated
that
the
united
states
invade
north
vietnam
,
even
if
it
meant
war
with
china
,
a
course
of
action
that
mcnamara
rejected
as
likely
to
cause
a
nuclear
war.
rostow
always
maintained
that
had
his
advice
to
the
president
to
invade
north
vietnam
been
taken
in
<year>
or
<year>
,
the
war
would
have
been
won
,
telling
karnow
in
an
interview
in
<year>
that
he
was
disappointed
that
johnson
rejected
his
advice
to
invade
north
vietnam.
johnson
remembered
how
the
approach
of
american
forces
upon
the
yalu
river
in
<year>
to
china
intervening
in
the
korean
war
,
and
he
was
very
fearful
that
an
american
invasion
of
north
vietnam
would
once
again
led
to
a
war
with
china
,
which
now
had
nuclear
weapons.
for
this
reason
,
johnson
was
always
against
invading
north
vietnam
as
the
risks
of
a
nuclear
war
with
china
were
too
awful
for
him
to
consider.
through
rostow
was
disappointed
that
johnson
rejected
his
advice
to
invade
north
vietnam
,
he
knew
better
than
to
stridently
press
that
idea
as
that
would
annoy
the
president
,
and
instead
he
brought
up
the
idea
of
invading
north
vietnam
every
so
often
a
couple
of
months
after
johnson
last
rejected
it.
rostow
also
chaired
a
secret
``
psychological
strategy
committee
''
whose
purpose
was
to
supply
``
correct
facts
''
about
the
vietnam
war
to
congress
,
the
media
and
the
american
people
in
general.in
june
<year>
,
janusz
lewandowski
,
the
polish
delegate
to
the
international
control
commission
,
which
was
supposed
to
police
the
geneva
accords
of
<year>
,
contacted
giovanni
d'orlandi
,
the
italian
ambassador
to
south
vietnam
with
a
peace
offer.
lewandowski
stated
he
just
spoken
with
ho
chi
minh
,
whom
he
claimed
wanted
a
``
political
compromise
''
to
end
the
war
and
would
go
``
quite
a
long
way
''
for
such
a
settlement.
lewandowski
reported
that
ho
was
willing
to
drop
his
demand
that
the
government
of
south
vietnam
be
overthrown
,
though
he
preferred
that
somebody
else
other
than
air
marshal
nguyen
cao
ky
serve
as
premier
;
asked
only
the
national
liberation
front
(
better
known
as
the
viet
cong
)
``
take
part
''
in
negotiations
,
instead
of
serving
in
the
government
;
and
were
willing
to
accept
a
``
reasonable
calendar
''
for
the
withdrawal
of
american
forces
instead
demanding
their
immediate
pull-out.
the
ambassador-at-large
harriman
and
his
deputy
,
the
former
cia
agent
chester
cooper
,
were
intrigued
by
the
polish
offer
,
which
was
backed
by
the
soviet
union.
ever
since
<year>
,
mao
zedong
had
been
accusing
the
soviet
union
of
capitulating
to
capitalism
and
abandoning
its
princioples
,
and
a
sino-soviet
competition
had
broken
out
about
which
of
the
two
states
was
most
willing
to
support
north
vietnam.
lewandowski
stated
that
the
soviets
were
tired
of
this
economically
exhausting
competition
because
every
time
china
increased
its
support
for
north
vietnam
,
the
soviets
had
to
increase
their
support
on
an
even
greater
scale
just
to
rebut
the
chinese
claim
that
they
were
``
selling
out
''
.d'orlandi
was
able
to
arrange
for
lewandowski
to
meet
henry
cabot
lodge
jr
,
the
u.s.
ambassador
in
saigon
,
and
the
talks
went
well.
by
november
<year>
,
it
was
arranged
that
john
gronouski
,
the
american
ambassador
in
warsaw
,
would
meet
with
north
vietnamese
diplomats
the
next
month
for
peace
talks
in
what
was
code-named
operation
marigold.
by
december
<year>
,
american
aircraft
bombed
oil
facilities
and
railroad
yards
in
hanoi
,
which
led
the
poles
to
warn
if
the
u.s.
continued
to
bomb
hanoi
,
the
talks
would
be
aborted.
rostow
told
the
president
that
he
believed
that
operation
marigold
was
a
``
trap
''
and
the
north
vietnamese
demand
that
hanoi
not
be
bombed
anymore
showed
the
bombing
campaign
was
indeed
working
as
he
promised
it
would.
on
december
<integer>
,
<year>
,
johnson
refused
harriman
's
request
to
cease
bombing
hanoi
and
a
week
later
,
the
planned
talks
in
warsaw
were
cancelled
as
the
north
vietnamese
announced
that
there
would
be
no
peace
talks
as
long
as
north
vietnam
was
being
bombed.
in
january
<year>
,
rostow
reported
to
johnson
that
the
viet
cong
were
``
disintegrating
''
under
the
american
pressure
,
writing
optimistically
that
the
major
problem
for
the
americans
in
the
coming
year
would
be
to
find
the
best
way
to
integrate
those
viet
cong
guerrillas
who
had
surrendered
back
into
civilian
life.
in
a
further
hopeful
sign
he
reported
to
the
president
in
the
same
month
that
the
bloody
chaos
of
the
cultural
revolution
had
pushed
china
to
the
brink
of
civil
war
as
``
mao
's
own
prestige
has
been
seriously
,
perhaps
irretrievably
,
tarnished
in
this
yet
unavailing
fracas
''
.
with
china
collapsing
into
chaos
,
he
believed
that
the
chinese
would
be
limited
in
their
ability
to
support
north
vietnam
for
some
time
to
come.
in
fact
,
mao
continued
to
support
north
vietnam
during
the
war
with
the
war
serving
as
a
foreign
policy
counterpart
to
the
cultural
revolution
as
the
``
great
helmsman
''
believed
that
extreme
violence
was
necessary
to
maintain
communist
``
purity
''
.
the
fact
that
some
of
mao
's
targets
in
the
cultural
revolution
such
as
liu
shaoqi
and
deng
xiaoping
were
opposed
to
increased
aid
to
north
vietnam
,
preferring
that
the
money
be
spent
on
chinese
development
instead
,
gave
him
an
additional
reason
to
support
north
vietnam.in
november
<year>
,
the
israeli
defense
force
raided
the
village
of
samu
'
in
jordan
,
a
move
which
angered
rostow
as
he
told
the
israeli
ambassador
abba
eban
that
king
hussein
of
jordan
was
an
american
ally
and
johnson
very
strongly
disapproved
of
the
raid.
rostow
stated
:
``
israel
for
some
machiavellian
reason
,
wanted
a
leftist
regime
on
the
left
bank
[
of
jordan
]
so
that
it
could
then
have
a
polarized
situation
in
which
the
russians
would
be
backing
the
arabs
and
the
u.s.
backing
israel
,
and
that
israel
would
not
be
in
an
embarrassing
position
where
one
of
its
friends
among
the
great
power
would
also
be
a
friend
of
an
arab
country
''
.in
february
<year>
,
the
soviet
premier
alexei
kosygin
visited
london
,
and
the
british
prime
minister
harold
wilson
tried
to
act
as
a
mediator
to
end
the
vietnam
war
,
offering
to
serve
as
an
honest
broker.
wilson
had
been
asked
in
<year>
to
send
a
british
contingent
to
fight
in
vietnam
,
but
as
his
labour
party
was
stoutly
opposed
to
britain
fighting
in
vietnam
,
he
had
refused
,
a
move
that
the
normally
anglophile
secretary
of
state
dean
rusk
called
a
``
betrayal
''
.
to
end
a
running
sore
in
anglo-american
relations
as
wilson
was
caught
between
the
americans
who
were
pressuring
him
to
send
british
forces
to
vietnam
and
his
own
party
who
were
pressuring
not
to
,
the
prime
minister
was
keen
to
end
the
vietnam
war.
kosygin
told
wilson
that
soviet
influence
in
north
vietnam
was
limited
as
the
north
vietnamese
sought
to
play
the
soviet
union
off
against
china
,
but
if
the
americans
were
willing
to
cease
their
bombing
of
north
vietnam
,
the
soviet
government
would
indeed
pressure
ho
chi
minh
to
open
peace
talks.
speaking
on
what
he
thought
was
a
secure
telephone
line
from
the
soviet
embassy
in
london
to
the
kremlin
,
kosygin
told
the
soviet
leader
leonid
brezhnev
that
there
was
a
``
great
opportunity
for
peace
''
,
through
in
the
same
call
he
admitted
that
the
militant
,
ultra-leftwing
line
taken
by
china
would
pose
problems.
unknown
to
kosygin
,
mi5
had
tapped
the
telephone
line
and
a
translated
transcript
of
his
call
to
brezhnev
was
forwarded
to
wilson.
the
transcript
convinced
wilson
that
kosygin
was
negotiating
in
good
faith
,
and
the
prime
minister
then
contracted
the
americans.
american
decision-makers
tended
to
exaggerate
soviet
influence
over
north
vietnam
,
and
wilson
's
message
that
kosygin
was
willing
to
apply
pressure
on
north
vietnam
was
seen
by
johnson
as
potentially
opening
the
door
for
peace.
johnson
directed
david
k.
e.
bruce
,
the
u.s.
ambassador
to
the
court
of
st.
james
together
with
harriman
's
deputy
chester
cooper
to
work
alongside
wilson
in
what
was
code-named
operation
sunflower.
rostow
reminded
johnson
of
wilson
's
``
betrayal
''
in
not
sending
british
forces
to
vietnam
and
advised
the
president
not
to
trust
him.
rostow
was
extremely
negative
about
operation
sunflower
,
called
wilson
a
vain
and
dishonest
man
who
was
working
to
end
the
vietnam
war
on
terms
unfavorable
to
the
united
states
,
and
did
his
best
to
fan
johnson
's
already
strong
dislike
of
wilson.
johnson
only
approved
of
operation
sunflower
because
it
would
be
too
politically
embarrassing
to
turn
an
opportunity
outright.working
closely
with
bruce
and
cooper
,
wilson
presented
a
ceasefire
offer
to
kosygin
on
<day>
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
,
which
kosygin
promised
would
be
passed
on
to
ho.
a
few
hours
later
,
cooper
left
his
hotel
to
attend
a
performance
of
fiddler
on
the
roof
while
informing
the
hotel
staff
that
he
would
be
at
the
theater
if
any
phone
calls
came
in
for
him.
cooper
was
at
the
theater
when
he
an
usherette
told
him
that
there
was
an
urgent
call
from
washington
,
saying
that
a
mr.
rostow
wanted
to
speak
with
him
at
once.
in
his
telephone
call
,
rostow
attacked
cooper
for
the
conciliatory
tone
of
wilson
's
letter
,
which
he
called
appeasement
,
and
demanding
it
be
rewritten
to
make
it
much
tougher
,
a
gesture
that
cooper
felt
was
meant
to
sabotage
operation
sunflower.
as
demanded
by
rostow
,
a
new
letter
with
considerably
more
confrontational
tone
was
given
to
kosygin
,
which
led
him
to
accuse
the
british
and
americans
of
negotiating
in
bad
faith.wilson
in
a
telephone
call
to
johnson
complained
that
the
letter
as
rewritten
by
rostow
had
ruined
the
peace
talks
and
caused
``
a
hell
of
a
situation
''
.
wilson
charged
that
kosygin
had
taken
a
major
risk
for
peace
in
vietnam

blamed
rostow
for
the
failure

telling
his
foreign

george

:
``
i
suspect
that
rostow

was
largely
responsible
for

to

had
been
squandered
as
all
kosygin
was
promising
was
to
pressure
ho
to
accept
a
ceasefire
and
as
he
himself
noted
that
when
the
soviets
pressured
the
north
vietnamese
to
do
something
that
they
did
not
want
to
do
,
they
just
drew
closer
to
china.
soviet
pressure
on
north
vietnam
tended
to
most
effective
in
conjugation
with
china
,
and
in
<year>
the
chinese
were
attacking
the
soviets
in
the
most
violent
terms
,
accusing
them
of
abandoning
true
communism
,
making
any
possibility

most
unlikely.
karnow
wrote
at

westmoreland
asked
for

for
south

,
a
request
that
was
supported
by
rostow.
rostow
went
further
than
westmoreland
by
asking
johnson
to
invade
north
vietnam
,
saying
that
the
american
people
wanted
their
president
``
do
something
big
and
hopefully
decisive
rather
than
small
''
.
at
the
meeting
of
the
national
security
council
,
rostow
paced
by
and
fourth
before
a
map
of
vietnam
with
a
pointer
,
showing
the
best
way
to
invade
while
the
defense

robert
mcnamara
,
countered
him
point
by
point
,
stating
that
the
dangers
of
chinese
intervention
were
far
too
great.
rostow
was
so
disappointed
that
johnson
was
more
influenced
by
mcnamara
than
himself
that
he
almost
resigned
in
protest
,
before
deciding
as
he
put
it
to
``
stay
with
johnson

the
last
day

''
.in
april
<year>
,
the
civil
rights
leader
martin
luther
king
jr.
came
out
against
the
vietnam
war
with
a
speech
in
new
york
denouncing
the
``
immoral
war
''
whose
burden
he
charged
fall
disproportionately
heavily
on
black
men
who
more
likely
to
be
drafted
to
fight
in
vietnam.
king
's
speech
increased
the
sense
of
siege
in
the
white
house
,
and
hence
rostow
's
influence.
in
july
<year>
,
allegations
of
police
brutality
led
to
race
riots
in
detroit
and
newark.
in
response
to
the
race
riots
,
conservative
republicans
and
democrats
accused
the
johnson
administration
's
civil
rights
reforms
as
being
the
root
reason
for
the
riots.
johnson
ordered
rostow
to
collect
``
such
evidence
as
there
is
on
external
involvement
in
the
violent
radical
community
of
the
negro
community
in
the
u.s
''
.
johnson
was
apparently
hoping
that
rostow
would
find
evidence
that
the
soviet
union
and/or
china
were
behind
the
riots
in
detroit
and
newark
,
but
his
national
security
adviser
was
unable
to
produce
any
such
evidence.
the
fact
that
rostow
was
ordered
to
investigate
an
essentially
domestic
matter
showed
that
the
president
thought
very
highly
of
him.
as
the
anti-war
protests
increased
,
rostow
was
able
to
reassure
johnson
that
history
will
vindicate
him
,
leading
the
president
to
remark
he
was
``
a
man
of
conviction
who
does
n't
try
to
play
president
''
.rostow
was
finally
able
to
persuade
johnson
in
june
<year>
to
bomb
north
vietnamese
oil
shortage
facilities
and
hydroelectric
plants
,
predicating
this
would
cause
the
collapse
of
north
vietnam
's
economy
and
win
the
war.
by
contrast
,
mcnamara
reported
to
the
president
in
the
summer
of
<year>
that
even
though
american
bombers
by
destroying
hydroelectric
plants
had
reduced
north
vietnam
's
capacity
to
generate
electricity
by
<integer>
%
,
it
had
failed
to
impact
meaningfully
on
the
war.
mcnamara
argued
to
johnson
that
rostow
did
not
understand
the
differences
between
germany
,
an
advanced
,
industrialized
first
world
nation
vs.
north
vietnam
,
a
backward
,
rural
third
nation
nation
,
and
that
paradoxically
that
north
vietnam
's
very
backwardness
was
a
form
of
strength.
mcnamara
noted
that
even
before
the
american
bombing
,
the
total
annual
hydroelectric
production
of
north
vietnam
amounted
only
to
a
fifth
of
the
annual
hydroelectric
production
produced
by
the
potomac
electric
power
company
's
plant
in
alexandria
,
virginia.
for
this
reason
,
mcnamara
stated
that
knocking
out
north
vietnam
's
hydroelectric
plants
did
not
have
the
same
catastrophic
effect
on
the
north
vietnamese
economy
that
knocking
out
america
's
hydroelectric
plants
would
have
had
on
the
american
economy.
likewise
,
north
vietnam
imported
all
of
its
oil
from
the
soviet
union
,
and
the
north
vietnamese
loaded
drums
of
oil
from
soviet
tankers
at
sea
to
sampans
,
which
then
entered
north
vietnam
via
that
country
's
intricate
network
of
rivers
and
canals.
for
this
reason
,
the
destruction
of
north
vietnam
's
oil
shortage
tanks
by
american
bombers
in
<year>
did
not
affect
north
vietnam
's
capacity
to
wage
war.
the
north
vietnamese
developed
a
system
of
hiding
the
oil
drums
underground
all
across
the
country.
despite
all
of
the
devastation
caused
by
the
american
bombing
between
<year>
and
<year>
with
ports
destroyed
and
oil
shortage
tanks
left
burning
,
north
vietnam
doubled
its
imports
of
soviet
oil
,
reaching
an
annual
total
of
<decimal>
million
tons
by
<year>.
the
north
vietnamese
built
some
<integer>
,
<integer>
miles
of
tunnels
and
underground
storage
areas
during
the
war
to
escape
the
bombing.
rostow
believed
that
the
bombing
tied
down
north
vietnamese
men
who
might
otherwise
fight
in
the
war
by
forcing
them
to
engage
in
reconstruction
work
,
but
the
north
vietnamese
government
had
proclaimed
a
``
total
war
''
,
mobilized
the
entire
population
for
the
war
,
and
put
women
to
work
reconstructing
the
damage
done
by
american
bombers.
additionally
,
some
<integer>
,
<integer>
chinese
soldiers
served
in
north
vietnam
between
<year>–<integer>
to
operate
anti-aircraft
guns
and
the
sams
(
surface
to
air
missiles
)
while
rebuilding
roads
and
bridges.while
working
as
national
security
advisor
,
rostow
became
involved
in
setting
the
united
states
'
posture
towards
israel.
concerns
about
israel
's
nuclear
program
were
tabled
by
the
united
states
during
the
build-up
to
the
six-day
war
and
its
aftermath.
although
he
supported
military
and
economic
assistance
to
israel
,
rostow
believed
that
increased
public
alignment
between
the
two
states
could
run
counter
to
us
diplomatic
and
oil
interests
in
the
region.
rostow
considered
president
gamal
abdel
nasser
of
egypt
to
be
a
moderating
force
who
through
he
talked
belligerently
of
war
,
in
fact
kept
the
arab-israeli
dispute
``
in
the
icebox
''
.
rostow
wrote
in
a
memo
advocating
american
economic
aid
to
egypt
:
``
while
no
one
likes
the
idea
of
paying
off
a
bully
,
nasser
is
still
the
most
powerful
figure
in
the
middle
east
...
and
has
restrained
wilder
arabs
who
have
for
a
disastrous
arab-israeli
showdown
''
.
after
reviewing
the
may
<year>
report
from
the
atomic
energy
commission
team
that
had
inspected
dimona
along
with
other
intelligence
,
rostow
informed
president
johnson
that
,
though
the
team
found
no
evidence
of
a
nuclear
weapons
program
,
``
there
are
enough
unanswered
questions
to
make
us
want
to
avoid
getting
locked
in
too
closely
with
israel.
when
egypt
remilitarized
the
sinai
in
may
<year>
,
rostow
did
not
support
an
israeli
strike
against
egypt
,
instead
writing
``
we
sympathize
with
eshkol
's
need
to
stop
these
[
palestinian
]
raids
and
reluctantly
admit
that
a
limited
attack
on
syria
may
be
his
only
answer
''
.
about
the
egyptian
remilitarization
,
rostow
wrote
that
goals
of
american
policy
must
be
``
(
a
)
prevent
israel
from
being
destroyed
(
b
)
stop
aggression
,
and
(
c
)
to
keep
u
thant
out
in
front
and
stiffen
his
spine
''
.
in
this
regard
,
rostow
wrote
it
was
essential
to
persuade
the
israeli
prime
minister
levi
eshkol
``
not
to
put
a
match
to
this
fuse
''
.
on
<day>
,
nasser
further
escalated
the
crisis
by
closing
the
straits
of
tiran
to
israeli
shipping
,
which
was
a
provocation
as
israel
had
always
stated
that
they
would
go
to
war
to
keep
the
straits
of
tiran
open.when
the
israelis
claimed
that
eisenhower
had
given
israel
a
security
``
guarantee
''
in
<year>
to
keep
open
the
straits
of
tiran
,
a
claim
that
mystified
the
americans
who
had
never
heard
of
this
``
guarantee
''
,
rostow
was
tasked
by
johnson
to
investigate.
the
answer
was
soon
found
;
eisenhower
had
written
a
letter
to
the
israeli
prime
minister
david
ben-gurion
in
<year>
committing
the
united
states
to
``
guarantee
''
that
the
straits
of
tiran
would
be
kept
open
to
israeli
shipping
by
the
united
states.
rostow
had
to
inform
the
israelis
that
only
treaties
ratified
by
congress
are
binding
on
the
united
states
,
and
presidential
promises
represent
only
a
moral
,
not
a
legal
commitment
on
the
part
of
the
united
states.
however
,
he
was
later
to
state
:
``
from
the
moment
eisenhower
made
clear
that
a
commitment
had
been
made
,
johnson
had
no
doubt
that
he
had
to
reopen
the
straits
''
.
rostow
backed
the
regatta
plan
under
which
a
group
of
various
nations
would
sail
their
ships
through
the
strait
of
tiran
as
a
show
of
support
for
israel.
rostow
believed
that
the
free
passage
of
israeli
ships
via
the
straits
of
tiran
was
a
``
naked
principle
''
the
united
states
should
uphold
even
it
meant
a
war
with
egypt.
as
more
and
more
nations
backed
out
of
the
regatta
plan
,
rostow
came
to
take
a
more
hawkish
stance
,
saying
to
johnson
that
israel
should
move
``
like
a
sheriff
in
high
noon
''
,
using
violence
``
necessary
to
achieve
not
merely
self-respect
,
but
respect
in
the
region
''
.
however
,
johnson
did
not
favor
war
to
resolve
the
crisis
,
but
as
he
appeared
to
be
backtracking
from
the
regatta
plan
,
eshkol
wrote
johnson
a
letter
noting
that
he
had
not
invaded
egypt
per
american
requests
,
but
still
the
straits
of
tiran
were
closed
to
israeli
shipping.
johnson
in
his
reply
stated
he
only
promised
to
use
all
of
his
constitutional
powers
to
reopen
the
straits
of
tiran
,
noting
that
because
of
the
vietnam
war
,
he
could
not
risk
getting
involving
in
another
war
at
present
,
telling
rostow
to
make
that
point
clear
to
the
israelis.
rostow
told
the
israeli
envoy
ephraim
evron
sent
to
washington
that
johnson
disliked
the
israeli
``
pressure
tactics
''
and
needed
more
time
to
study
the
issues.
rostow
informed
evron
:
``
you
have
known
president
johnson
for
a
long
time
and
have
a
right
to
make
your
own
assessment
''
.
evron
predicated
that
israel
would
probably
go
to
war
if
nothing
was
done
to
reopen
the
straits
of
tiran
,
telling
rostow
that
were
``
about
ten
days
''
of
peace
left.though
rostow
,
johnson
,
and
secretary
of
state
dean
rusk
tried
to
convince
israel
not
to
resort
to
military
force
,
they
supported
israel
once
the
war
began.
rostow
told
the
egyptian
ambassador
,
mustafa
kamel
just
before
the
war
:
``
your
adversaries
believe
that
a
surprise
attack
by
egypt
and
syria
is
imminent.
we
know
this
is
unthinkable.
we
can
not
believe
the
government
of
the
uar
[
united
arab
republic
]
would
be
so
reckless.
such
a
course
would
obviously
have
the
most
serious
possible
consequences
''
.
rostow
added
that
israel
had
also
been
given
a
similar
``
friendly
warning
''
not
to
escalate.
shortly
before
the
war
began
,
johnson
asked
rostow
what
he
thought
israel
was
going
to
do
,
leading
rostow
to
reply
``
they
're
going
to
hit
''
.
at
about
<integer>
:
<integer>
am
on
<day>
,
rostow
phoned
johnson
to
tell
him
that
israel
had
just
attacked
egypt
with
the
israeli
air
force
striking
egyptian
air
force
bases
all
over
egypt.
on
the
first
day
of
the
six
day
war
,
rostow
submitted
a
report
to
johnson
about
the
destruction
of
the
egyptian
air
force
that
began
:
``
herewith
the
account
,
with
a
map
,
of
the
first
day
's
turkey
shoot
''
.
later
that
day
,
rostow
in
a
memo
to
the
president
wrote
``
we
should
begin
...
talking
with
the
russians
and
,
if
possible
,
with
others
about
the
terms
of
a
settlement
...
.a
ceasefire
will
not
answer
the
fundamental
questions
in
the
minds
of
israelis
until
they
have
acquired
so
much
real
estate
and
destroyed
so
many
egyptian
planes
and
tanks
that
they
are
absolutely
sure
of
their
bargaining
position
''
.once
the
war
began
,
rostow
saw
an
opportunity
for
the
united
states
,
writing
that
the
issue
``
was
whether
the
settlement
of
this
war
shall
be
on
the
basis
of
armistice
agreements
,
which
leave
the
arabs
in
the
posture
of
hostilities
towards
israel
,
keeping
alive
the
israeli
issue
in
arab
political
life
as
a
unifying
force
,
and
affording
the
soviet
union
a
handle
on
the
arab
world
;
or
whether
a
settlement
emerges
in
which
israel
is
accepted
as
a
middle
eastern
state
''
.
rostow
believed
that
the
possibility
of
israel
gaining
territory
would
allow
a
``
land
for
peace
''
deal
which
might
finally
end
the
arab-israeli
dispute
,
which
led
him
to
advocate
no
ceasefire
to
end
the
war
until
israel
captured
the
golan
heights
from
syria
as
he
maintained
the
syrians
would
never
make
peace
until
an
initiative
was
provided.
rostow
favored
having
a
peace
plan
calling
for
``
land
for
peace
''
deal
to
be
issued
by
the
united
nations
,
with
the
negotiations
to
be
mediated
by
the
united
states.
rostow
made
it
clear
that
he
did
not
envision
israel
permanently
occupying
the
gaza
strip
,
the
west
bank
,
east
jerusalem
,
the
golan
heights
and
the
sinai
,
believing
that
an
occupation
would
ensure
that
the
arab-israeli
conflict
would
never
end.
by
the
third
day
of
the
six
day
war
,
israeli
officials
were
starting
to
hint
that
they
were
not
willing
to
give
up
some
of
their
recent
territorial
gains
,
especially
east
jerusalem.
in
october
<year>
,
rostow
advised
johnson
that
with
israel
``
we
lean
against
them
just
enough
to
keep
their
thinking
from
becoming
too
quickly
set
in
the
concrete
of
their
current
extended
territorial
possessions
''
.
when
the
nuclear
issue
resurfaced
in
january
<year>
,
just
prior
to
prime
minister
levi
eshkol
's
visit
to
the
united
states
,
rostow
recommended
that
the
president
make
it
clear
that
the
united
states
expected
israel
to
sign
the
npt.in
september–october
<year>
,
operation
pennsylvania
peace
initiative
was
launched
,
when
a
professor
of
political
science
at
harvard
,
henry
kissinger
,
got
into
contact
with
a
french
biologist
,
herbert
marcovich
,
who
in
turns
was
friends
with
the
resistance
hero
,
raymond
aubrac
who
was
a
friend
of
ho
chi
minh.
aubrac
and
marchovich
visited
hanoi
to
meet
ho
to
discuss
peace.
rostow
was
opposed
to
operation
pennsylvania
plan
,
and
turn
his
best
to
turn
johnson
against
it.
under
rostow
's
influence
,
johnson
sent
a
message
to
kissinger
:
``
i
'm
going
to
give
it
one
more
try
and
if
it
does
n't
work
i
'm
going
to
come
up
to
cambridge
and
cut
off
your
balls
!
''
kissinger
contacted
rostow
to
urge
that
the
u.s
pause
the
bombing
to
give
operation
pennsylvania
a
chance
,
only
to
be
rebuffed.
kissinger
was
later
to
call
rostow
a
``
fool
''
.during
the
siege
of
khe
sanh
in
january
<year>
,
rostow
reported
to
president
johnson
that
the
north
vietnamese
were
sending
their
forces
to
``
re-enact
a
new
dienbienphu
''
,
predicating
that
khe
sanh
would
be
the
decisive
battle
in
<year>
and
the
united
states
must
commit
all
of
its
forces
to
prevent
the
fall
of
khe
sahn.
in
this
,
rostow
was
playing
into
north
vietnamese
hands
as
the
intention
by
hanoi
was
to
draw
away
american
forces
from
the
main
cities
of
south
vietnam
as
the
prelude
for
the
tet
offensive.
during
the
tet
offensive
in
<year>
,
rostow
in
a
report
stated
that
a
vietcong
attack
against
a
remote
village
in
south
vietnam
had
been
timed
to
coincide
with
a
debate
in
congress
about
appropriations
for
the
war
,
leading
karnow
to
sarcastically
write
``
as
if
tacticians
in
hanoi
consulted
the
congressional
record
before
deploying
their
units
''
.
during
the
tet
offensive
,
rostow
urged
johnson
to
give
a
``
war
leader
speech
''
in
preference
to
a
``
peace
leader
speech
''
.
in
february
<year>
,
rostow
clashed
repeatedly
with
the
cia
director
,
richard
helms
,
who
accused
him
of
distorting
intelligence
to
present
a
more
optimistic
picture
of
the
war
than
was
warranted.during
the
debate
in
washington
in
the
aftermath
of
the
tet
offensive
about
whatever
to
send
more
troops
to
south
vietnam
or
not
,
rostow
argued
that
firmness
in
vietnam
was
needed
to
deter
``
aggression
...
in
the
middle
east
,
elsewhere
in
asia
and
perhaps
even
in
europe
''
and
recommended
that
u.s
ground
forces
enter
north
vietnam
and
laos
to
sever
the
ho
chi
minh
trail.
rostow
urged
johnson
that
``
it
is
time
for
a
war
leader
speech
instead
of
a
peace-seeker
speech
''
.
in
the
aftermath
of
the
tet
offensive
,
rostow
argued
that
now
was
the
time
to
finish
off
the
vietnamese
communists
and
urged
johnson
to
send
<integer>
,
<integer>
more
american
troops
to
south
vietnam
to
join
the
half-million
already
there
and
to
bomb
north
vietnam
even
harder.
during
the
debates
,
the
out-going
defense
secretary
robert
mcnamara
,
who
had
been
repeatedly
bested
in
debates
by
rostow
,
snapped
in
fury
:
``
what
then
?
this
goddamned
bombing
campaign
,
it
's
worth
nothing
,
it
's
done
nothing
,
they
dropped
more
bombs
than
on
all
of
europe
in
all
of
world
war
ii
and
it
has
n't
done
a
fucking
thing
!
''
at
that
point
,
mcnamara
,
who
had
become
disillusioned
with
the
war
he
had
once
supported
,
broke
down
in
tears
,
asking
johnson
plaintively
to
stop
listening
to
rostow
and
saying
the
war
could
not
be
won.
rostow
had
supported
johnson
's
decision
to
appoint
clark
clifford
as
defense
secretary
as
he
was
known
to
be
a
hawk
,
and
was
greatly
dismayed
when
the
new
defense
secretary
turned
out
to
be
more
of
a
dove
than
mcnamara
was.johnson
was
badly
spooked
by
his
near-defeat
in
the
new
hampshire
democratic
primary
,
which
he
won
by
only
<integer>
votes
against
the
anti-war
senator
eugene
mccarthy
,
a
politician
whom
many
people
did
not
take
seriously.
even
worryingly
for
johnson
,
inspired
by
this
display
of
presidential
weakness
in
new
hampshire
,
senator
robert
f.
kennedy
,
a
politician
whom
many
people
did
take
seriously
,
entered
the
democratic
primaries
on
an
anti-war
platform
on
<day>.
for
the
wisconsin
democratic
primary
scheduled
for
<day>
,
the
polls
in
march
<year>
showed
kennedy
in
the
lead
,
mccarthy
coming
in
second
and
johnson
humiliatingly
coming
in
third.
faced
with
a
situation
where
there
was
a
real
possibility
of
him
losing
the
democratic
nomination
to
be
his
party
's
candidate
in
the
<year>
election
,
johnson
decided
to
consider
a
political
as
opposed
to
a
military
solution
to
the
vietnam
war.
clifford
had
despite
expectations
turned
out
to
be
more
dovish
in
office
,
and
pressed
the
president
to
find
an
``
honorable
way
out
''
of
vietnam.
johnson
sought
the
advice
of
the
so-called
``
wise
men
''
,
a
group
of
elder
statesmen
who
advised
him
to
find
a
way
to
end
the
war.
the
leader
of
the
``
wise
men
''
,
the
former
secretary
of
state
dean
acheson
,
told
rostow
``
tell
the
president—and
you
tell
him
in
precisely
these
words—that
he
can
take
vietnam
and
stick
it
up
his
ass
''
.
on
<integer>
march
,
when
johnson
met
the
``
wise
men
''
,
he
was
informed
that
``
we
must
take
steps
to
disengage
''
.
johnson
's
highest
level
of
education
had
been
at
the
southwest
texas
teacher
's
college
,
and
throughout
his
life
,
he
had
much
respect
for
those
with
university
degrees
from
the
``
eastern
establishment
''
.
of
the
<integer>
``
wise
men
''
,
only
general
omar
bradly
,
supreme
court
justice
abe
fortas
,
the
diplomat
robert
murphy
and
general
maxwell
taylor
favored
fighting
on
with
the
other
ten
favoring
disengagement.during
the
<year>
election
,
rostow
did
his
best
to
sabotage
the
peace
talks
going
on
paris
as
the
american
delegation
led
by
his
old
enemy
harriman
negotiated
with
the
north
vietnamese
in
paris.
by
this
point
,
rostow
was
consumed
with
hatred
for
harriman
,
and
he
missed
an
opportunity
to
disparage
to
johnson.
on
<day>
,
rostow
that
harriman
should
not
head
the
american
peace
delegation
to
paris
because
``
he
lacks—and
always
lacked—an
understanding
and
sympathy
with
the
south
vietnamese
''
.
through
johnson
was
sympathetic
,
he
argued
that
harriman
's
record
as
a
distinguished
diplomat
going
back
to
world
war
ii
qualified
him
to
head
the
delegation.
rostow
attached
to
the
peace
delegation
a
staffer
from
the
national
security
council
,
william
jorden
,
with
orders
``
to
keep
an
eye
on
those
bastards
and
make
sure
that
they
did
n't
give
away
the
family
jewels
''
.rostow
changed
his
opinions
to
suit
the
president
's
changed
mood
in
the
summer
of
<year>
and
now
advised
johnson
to
limit
the
bombing
raids
against
north
vietnam.
by
the
time
of
the
democratic
convention
in
chicago
in
august
<year>
,
rostow
approved
of
the
compromise
campaign
plank
of
the
man
who
won
the
democratic
nomination
,
vice
president
hubert
humphrey
,
which
called
for
an
end
of
the
u.s.
bombing
of
north
vietnam
,
as
by
this
point
he
feared
that
the
republican
candidate
,
richard
nixon
,
would
win
the
election.
by
august
<year>
,
the
democratic
party
was
tearing
itself
apart
,
divisions
that
were
all
too
apparent
at
the
democratic
convention
where
anti-war
and
pro-war
democrats
vehemently
debated
on
the
convention
floor
about
whatever
the
united
states
should
continue
fighting
in
vietnam
or
not.
given
the
disarray
in
the
democratic
ranks
,
it
was
widely
felt
if
the
party
did
not
find
a
way
of
unifying
itself
,
nixon
would
win.
when
humphrey
asked
for
rostow
's
help
with
campaign
slogans
,
rostow
came
up
with
the
awkward
``
we
're
not
going
to
let
a
handful
of
white
and
black
punks
turn
this
country
over
to
wallace
,
strom
thurmond
,
and
those
who
base
their
campaigns
on
their
support
''
.
by
this
,
rostow
meant
that
a
divided
democratic
party
might
allow
people
like
george
wallace
,
the
outspoken
white
supremacist
former
governor
of
alabama
who
was
running
for
president
as
a
third-party
candidate
,
or
senator
storm
thurmond
,
a
democrat
who
turned
republican
out
of
his
opposition
to
civil
rights
for
afro-americans
,
would
come
to
power.based
upon
information
provided
by
the
national
security
agency
,
which
broken
the
south
vietnamese
diplomatic
codes
,
senior
officials
johnson
administration
had
learned
that
anna
chennault
,
the
chairwoman
of
the
republican
women
for
nixon
group
had
met
the
south
vietnamese
ambassador
,
bui
diem
,
to
tell
him
that
south
vietnam
should
sabotage
paris
peace
talks
to
improve
the
chances
of
nixon
winning
the
election.
on
<day>
,
rostow
told
johnson
he
now
had
information
``
on
how
certain
republicans
may
have
inflamed
the
south
vietnamese
to
behave
as
they
have
been
behaving
''
.
rostow
also
advised
johnson
not
to
go
public
with
this
information
,
saying
he
should
instead
tell
nixon
in
private
to
keep
away
from
chennault
,
advice
which
was
taken.
by
the
fall
of
<year>
,
rostow
had
come
to
feel
that
it
was
better
if
nixon
won
the
election
rather
than
the
``
defeatist
''
humphrey
who
on
the
campaign
trail
had
become
increasingly
critical
of
the
war.
in
one
of
his
memos
to
johnson
,
rostow
,
who
was
still
unhappy
about
johnson
's
decision
not
to
invade
north
vietnam
,
wrote
he
should
say
if
asked
about
civilian-military
relations
:
``
generally
speaking
,
the
military
has
wanted
us
to
use
more
power
,
earlier
and
faster.
they
may
have
been
right.
but
the
president
had
other
considerations
to
think
of
''
.
it
was
a
mark
of
rostow
's
influence
that
johnson
,
who
was
well
known
for
being
abrasive
towards
subordinates
,
did
not
explode
in
rage
as
he
would
have
if
anyone
else
wrote
such
a
memo.

when
richard
nixon
became
president
in
<year>
,
rostow
left
office
,
and
over
the
next

years
taught
economics
at
the
lyndon

school
of
public
affairs
at
the
university
of
texas
at
austin
with
his
wife
elspeth
rostow
,
who
later
became
dean
of

school.
in
<year>
,
he
was
told
that
because
of
his
support
for
the
vietnam
war
that
he
was
not
welcome
to
resume
teaching
at
mit
,
forcing
him
to
take
up
a
position
at
the
university
of
texas.
by
<year>
the
general
consensus
amongst
the
liberal
american
intelligentsia
was
that
the
vietnam
war
was
a
horrific
mistake
of
epic
proportions
and
when
rostow
left
government
service
in
january
<year>
,
he
found
himself
an
unpopular
figure
with
the
liberal
intelligentsia
,
making
it
impossible
for
him
to
return
to
mit.
rostow
's
biographer
,
the
british
historian
david
milne
,
wrote
:
``
in
<year>
,
rostow
's
notoriety
was
such
that
none
of
america
's
elite
universities
were
willing
to
offer
him
a
job
''
.
for
a
man
who
had
previously
held
professorships
at
harvard
,
oxford
,
cambridge
,
and
the
mit
,
it
was
considered
within
academic
circles
to
be
a
real
comedown
for
him
to
teach
at
the
university
of
texas.he
wrote
extensively
in
defense
of
neoliberal
economics
,
particularly
in
developing
nations.
rostow
's
successor
as
national
security
adviser
,
the
harvard
professor
,
henry
kissinger
,
was
obsessed
with
the
fear
of
becoming
``
this
administration
's
walt
rostow
''
whose
support
for
the
vietnam
war
ruined
his
reputation
with
the
liberal
sections
of
the
american
intelligentsia
and
led
him
teaching
at
the
university
of
texas
,
which
was
regarded
as
a
second-rate
university
,
a
fate
that
kissinger
was
keen
to
avoid.
kissinger
wanted
to
resume
his
professorship
at
harvard
as
he
did
not
want
to
end
up
teaching
at
an
``
unacceptable
''
institution
like
the
university
of
texas
as
rostow
did.rostow
himself
noted
that
the
university
of
texas
campus
was
ultra-modern
as
the
texas
government
had
used
its
oil
wealth
to
create
a
gleaming
,
modernistic
campus
,
but
complained
that
the
university
administration
was
more
interested
in
supporting
the
football
team
,
the
longhorns
,
than
in
research
and
teaching.
from
<year>
to
<year>
,
rostow
served
as
one
of
the
ghostwriters
on
johnson
's
memoir
,
the
vantage
point
,
writing
all
of
the
chapters
dealing
with
foreign
affairs.
as
the
teaching
load
at
the
university
of
texas
was
very
light
,
rostow
had
much
time
for
research
and
between
<year>
and
<year>
wrote
<integer>
books
,
mostly
on
world
economic
history
with
a
particular
focus
on
economic
modernization.
in
his
own
memoir
,
the
diffusion
of
power
,
rostow
argued
that
for
the
justice
of
the
vietnam
war
and
lashed
out
at
kennedy
for
ignoring
his
advice
in
<year>
to
invade
north
vietnam
,
writing
that
this
``
was
the
greatest
single
error
of
u.s
foreign
policy
in
the
<year>s
''
.
reflecting
his
friendship
with
johnson
,
rostow
was
less
harsh
towards
him
in
his
memoir
,
but
still
he
charged
that
johnson
was
too
worried
about
the
possibility
of
a
nuclear
war
with
china
and
should
have
taken
his
advice
to
invade
north
vietnam
,
arguing
that
the
risk
of
a
nuclear
war
with
china
was
acceptable.
the
main
villain
in
the
diffusion
of
power
was
mcnamara
,
who
rostow
accused
of
being
a
defeatist
from
<year>
onward
,
charging
that
it
was
his
weakness
and
doubts
about
the
war
that
caused
johnson
to
hold
back
and
not
invade
north
vietnam.in
the
<year>s
,
rostow
visited
south
korea
,
whose
economy
had
greatly
industrialized
under
the
rule
of
general
park.
during
his
visit
,
rostow
praised
south
korea
as
the
best
example
of
the
theories
he
set
out
in
the
stages
of
economic
growth
,
arguing
that
general
park
's
policies
had
indeed
pushed
south
korea
into
an
``
industrial
take-off
''
.
in
<year>
,
rostow
told
the
south
korean
economist
park
taey-gyun
that
the
experience
of
south
korea
proved
the
correctness
of
the
stages
of
economic
growth
and
expressed
the
wish
that
more
third
world
leaders
had
been
like
general
park
;
though
the
economist
park
noted
that
general
park
's
policy
of
five
year
plans
did
not
reflect
rostow
's
ideas.in
<year>
,
a
book
by
rostow
the
united
states
and
the
regional
organization
of
asia
and
the
pacific
,
<year>–<year>
was
published.
in
this
book
,
rostow
advanced
the
thesis
that
the
united
states
had
actually
``
won
''
the
vietnam
war
,
as
he
contended
the
war
had
``
brought
time
''
for
the
rest
of
south-east
asia
to
economically
advance
and
escape
communism.
rostow
based
his
argument
along
the
contention
that
based
on
the
ways
things
were
going
in
south
vietnam
in
<year>
that
the
country
would
have
fallen
to
the
communists
that
year
,
and
the
american
intervention
,
which
though
it
failed
to
save
south
vietnam
in
the
end
,
gave
an
extra
ten
years
to
allow
the
rest
of
south-east
asia
to
economically
advance
,
ensuring
that
the
other
``
dominoes
''
did
not
fall.
rostow
argued
that
the
economic
success
of
most
of
the
members
of
the
association
of
south-east
asian
nations
,
which
comprised
indonesia
,
malaysia
,
singapore
,
brunei
,
thailand
and
the
philippines
was
due
to
the
vietnam
war
``
buying
time
''
for
them
,
as
none
of
those
nations
ended
up
being
communist
and
with
the
exception
of
the
philippines
,
all
of
them
were
``
asian
tigers
''
(
i.e.
rapidly
growing
economies
)
.in
<year>
,
mcnamara
published
his
memoir
in
retrospect
when
he
famously
declared
about
the
vietnam
war
``
we
were
wrong
,
terribly
wrong
''
.
on
<day>
in
the
times
literacy
supplement
,
rostow
wrote
a
scathing
review
of
in
retrospect
under
the
title
``
the
case
for
the
war
''
,
where
he
accused
mcnamara
of
insulting
all
of
the
families
of
americans
who
died
in
vietnam
and
argued
that
the
united
states
had
in
fact
``
won
''
the
vietnam
war
as
the
non-communist
states
of
southeast
asia
``
had
quadrupled
their
real
gnp
between
<year>
and
<year>
''
,
which
rostow
argued
would
not
have
happened
had
the
united
states
not
fought
in
vietnam.
the
review
in
the
times
literacy
supplement
reflected
the
intense
feud
between
mcnamara
and
rostow
;
the
latter
made
much
of
the
fact
that
mcnamara
often
suffered
from
depression
and
suggested
that
his
``
defeatism
''
was
due
to
an
unsound
mind.
rostow
believed
that
mcnamara
had
suffered
a
nervous
breakdown
in
<year>
and
his
``
defeatism
''
about
vietnam
was
due
to
the
fact
he
had
``
cracked
''
under
the
strain
of
war.
milne
wrote
that
it
is
indeed
correct
that
mcnamara
suffered
from
bouts
of
depression
,
but
there
is
nothing
to
support
rostow
's
claim
he
had
lost
his
mind
as
defense
secretary.
milne
also
wrote
that
rostow
's
assertion
that
high
economic
growth
rates
in
southeast
asia
justified
the
vietnam
war
was
callous
towards
the
families
of
all
the
americans
and
vietnamese
who
died
in
the
war.

==
biography
==
during
his
school
years
in
the
hills
above
oakland
,
california
,
where
his
father
was
a
woodworker
,
he
developed
such
a
passion
for
entomology
that
he
acquired
the
nickname
``
bugs.
''
he
would
go
on
summer
camping
trips
organized
by
the
boy
scout
leader
``
bugsy
''
cain
,
and
developed
a
circle
of
boyhood
friends
who
went
on
to
become
entomologists
,
including
robert
l.
usinger
,
judson
linsley
gressitt
,
and
e.
gorton
linsley.
at
first
he
collected
butterflies
,
but
began
to
concentrate
on
weevils
at
the
suggestion
of
a
professor
at
the
nearby
university
of
california
,
berkeley.
during
a
camping
trip
in
<year>
,
he
discovered
a
new
species
of
weevil
that
became
the
subject
of
his
first
academic
publication
,
in
<year>
,
soon
after
enrolling
in
uc
berkeley
,
where
he
received
a
b.s.
degree
in
<year>.on
the
basis
of
his
considerable
field
experience
and
his
earlier
work
mounting
specimens
of
hawaiian
and
pacific
insects
for
the
pacific
entomological
survey
,
which
was
then
headquartered
at
uc
berkeley
,
his
mentors
there
recommended
him
to
serve
as
the
field
entomologist
on
the
bernice
p.
bishop
museum
's
mangarevan
expedition
to
southeastern
polynesia
in
<year>.
his
senior
colleagues
on
that
expedition
gave
him
a
new
,
lifelong
nickname
,
``
zimmie
,
''
and
his
close-up
encounters
with
a
wide
variety
of
island
ecosystems
gave
him
a
new
,
enduring
passion
for
biogeography.he
settled
in
honolulu
in
<year>
,
where
he
worked
as
an
entomologist
for
the
bishop
museum
and
conceived
the
idea
for
a
single-author
,
multivolume
insects
of
hawaii
monograph
modeled
on
the
insects
of
western
north
america
(
<year>
)
by
his
berkeley
mentor
,
edward
oliver
essig.
by
<year>
,
he
had
completed
the
first
five
volumes
,
but
bishop
museum
director
peter
h.
buck
was
more
eager
to
publish
new
works
in
anthropology
than
in
entomology
,
so
zimmerman
turned
instead
to
the
university
of
hawaiʻi
,
whose
president
,
gregg
m.
sinclair
,
agreed
to
publish
the
volumes
under
the
auspices
of
the
newly
established
university
of
hawaiʻi
press.
the
first
five
volumes
finally
appeared—to
considerable
local
and
international
acclaim—in
<year>
,
the
same
year
that
their
author
received
a
fulbright
fellowship
to
work
at
the
british
natural
history
museum
on
its
large
holdings
of
hawaiian
insects
,
many
of
them
collected
by
r.
c.
l.
perkins
over
a
period
of
<integer>
years
beginning
in
the
<year>s
,
at
a
time
when
many
native
fauna
were
disappearing.zimmerman
spent
most
of
the
next
two
decades
living
on
grant
money
and
private
funds
,
in
london
as
an
honorary
associate
of
the
british
museum
and
in
peterborough
,
new
hampshire
,
where
he
had
easy
access
to
the
museum
of
comparative
zoology
at
harvard
university.
he
completed
a
ph.d.
from
the
university
of
london
in
<year>
,
published
three
more
volumes
of
insects
of
hawaii
in
<year>–<integer>
,
and
prepared
one
more
that
languished
in
the
pipeline
until
<year>.
he
was
also
made
a
life-fellow
of
the
american
association
for
the
advancement
of
science
in
<year>.
meanwhile
,
back
in
honolulu
,
d.
elmo
hardy
and
others
began
publishing
further
volumes
of
insects
of
hawaii
devoted
to
the
exceptionally
rich
variety
of
diptera
(
true
flies
)
in
the
islands
,
a
variety
zimmerman
had
called
attention
to
in
a
short
contribution
to
evolution
in
<year>
with
the
provocative
title
,
``

''
(

helped
stimulate
one
of

most
outstanding

scientifically
rewarding
long-term

in
the
history

biology
,
encompassing
systematics
,
genetics
,
ecology
,
and

of
the

by
the
<year>s
,
however
,
zimmerman
had
trouble
securing
the
funds
needed
to
keep
working
on
insects
of
hawaii
and
ended
up
accepting
a
generous
offer
from
douglas
waterhouse
at
australia
's
csiro
to
turn
his
attention
to
producing
another
ambitious
multivolume
monograph
,
this
time
on
australian
weevils.
by
<year>
,
he
had
the
first
five
volumes
ready
to
publish
,
only
to
find
that
funding
for
this
project
,
too
,
had
dried
up.
he
and
his
wife
sold
much
of
their
estate
,
not
just
to
subsidize
publication
,
but
also
to
endow
an
ongoing
position
at
csiro
for
research
on
pacific
weevils.
in
<year>
,
they
moved
from
their
cattle
ranch
near
canberra
to

after
attending
oslo
cathedral
school
,
haavelmo
received
a
degree
in
economics
from
the
university
of
oslo
in
<year>
and
eventually
joined
the
institute
of
economics
with
the
recommendation
of
ragnar
frisch.
haavelmo
was
frisch

assistant
for
a
period
of
time
until
he
was
appointed
as
head
of
computations
for
the
institute.
in
<year>
,
haavelmo
studied
statistics
at
university
college
london
while
he
subsequently
traveled
to
berlin
,
geneva
,
and
oxford
for
additional
studies.
haavelmo
assumed
a
lecturing
position
at
the
university
of
aarhus
in
<year>
for
one
year
and
then
in
the
subsequent
year
was
offered
an
academic
scholarship
to
travel
abroad
and
study
in
the
united
states.
during
world
war
ii
he
worked
with
nortraship
in
the
statistical
department
in
new
york
city.
he
received
his
phd
in
<year>
for
his
work
on
the
probability
approach
in
econometrics.he
was
a
professor
of
economics

statistics
at
the
university
of
oslo
between
<year>–<integer>
and
was
the
trade
department
head
of
division
from
<year>–<integer>.
haavelmo
acquired
a
prominent
position
in
modern
economics
through
his
logical
critique
of
a
series
of
custom
conceptions
in
mathematical
analysis.in
<year>
,
haavelmo
was
awarded
the
nobel
prize
in
economics
``
for
his
clarification
of
the
probability
theory
foundations
of
econometrics
and
his
analyses
of
simultaneous
economic
structures.

haavelmo
resided
at

legacy
==
judea
pearl
wrote
``
haavelmo
was
the
first
to
recognize
the
capacity
of
economic
models
to
guide
policies
''
and
``
presented
a
mathematical
procedure
that
takes
an
arbitrary
model
and
produces
quantitative
answers
to
policy
questions
''
.
according
to
pearl
,
``
haavelmo
's
paper
,
'the
statistical
implications
of
a
system
of
simultaneous
equations
'
,
marks
a
pivotal
turning
point
,
not
in
the
statistical
implications
of
econometric
models
,
as
historians
typically
presume
,
but
in
their
causal
counterparts.
''
haavelmo
's
idea
that
an
economic
model
depicts
a
series
of
hypothetical
experiments
and
that
policies
can
be
simulated
by
modifying
equations
in
the
model
became
the
basis
of
all
currently
used
formalisms
of
econometric
causal
inference.
(
the
biostatistics
and
epidemiology
literature
on
causal
inference
draws
from
different
sources.
)
it
was
first
operationalized
by
robert
h.
strotz
and
herman
wold
(
<year>
)
who
advocated
``
wiping
out
''
selected
equations
,
and
then
translated
into
graphical
models
as
``
wiping
out
''
incoming
arrows.
this
operation
has
subsequently
led
to
pearl
's
``
do
''
-calculus
and
to
a
mathematical
theory
of
counterfactuals
in
econometric
models.
pearl
further
speculates
that
the
reason
economists
do
not
generally
appreciate
these
revolutionary
contributions
of
haavelmo
is
because
economists
themselves
have
still
not
reached
consensus
of
what
an
economic
model
stands
for
,
as
attested
by
profound
disagreements
among
econometric
textbooks.

dancoff
(
september
<integer>
,
<year>
in
philadelphia
–
august
<integer>
,
<year>
in
urbana
,
illinois
)
was
an
american
theoretical
physicist
best
known
for
the
tamm–dancoff
approximation
method
and
for
nearly
developing
a
renormalization
method
for
solving
quantum
electrodynamics
(
qed
)
.
dancoff
was
raised
in
the
squirrel
hill
neighborhood
of
pittsburgh.
he
attended
carnegie
tech
on
a
private
scholarship
and
received
his
b.s.
in
physics
in
<year>
,
followed
by
a
master
's
degree
from
the
university
of
pittsburgh
in
<year>.
he
then
went
to
the
university
of
california
at
berkeley
where
he
earned
his
phd
in
<year>
under
robert
oppenheimer.while
dancoff
was
at
berkeley
,
oppenheimer
suggested
that
he
work
on
the
calculation
of
the
scattering
of
a
relativistic
electron
by
an
electric
field.
such
qed
calculations
typically
gave
infinite
answers.
following
earlier
perturbation-theory
work
by
oppenheimer
and
felix
bloch
,
he
found
that
he
could
deal
in
various
ways
with
the
infinities
that
arose
,
sometimes
by
canceling
a
positive
infinity
with
a
negative
one.
however
,
some
infinities
remained
uncanceled
and
the
method
(
later
called
renormalization
)
did
not
give
finite
results.
he
published
a
general
description
of
this
work
in
<year>.in
<year>
,
sin-itiro
tomonaga
and
his
students
revisited
this
paper.
using
improved
calculational
methods
,
they
found
that
dancoff
had
omitted
one
term
or
two
terms.
once
they
repaired
this
omission
,
dancoff
's
method
worked
,
and
they
built
on
it
to
produce
a
theory
of
qed
,
for
which
tomonaga
shared
the
nobel
prize
in
<year>.
(
at
the
same
time
,
american
physicists
discovered
dancoff
's
error
and
solved
qed
,
relying
less
directly
on
dancoff.
)
during
the
second
world
war
,
dancoff
worked
on
the
theory
of
the
newly
invented
nuclear
reactors.
to
take
into
account
how
fuel
rods
could
``
shadow
''
other
rods
by
absorbing
neutrons
headed
toward
the
other
rods
,
he
and
m.
ginsburg
developed
the
dancoff
factor
,
still
used
in
reactor
calculations.after
the
war
,
dancoff
was
on
the
faculty
of
the
university
of
illinois
at
urbana-champaign.
in
<year>
he
published
an
approximation
method
for
many-body
theory
that
has
been
used
in
nuclear
and
solid-state
physics.
igor
tamm
had
found
it
in
<year>
,
and
the
method
is
now
named
after
both.
in
the
late
<year>s
,
dancoff
began
a
collaboration
with
the
viennese-refugee
physician
and
radiologist
henry
quastler
in
the
new
field
of
cybernetics
and
information
theory.
their
work
led
to
the
publication
of
what
is
now
commonly
called
dancoff
's
law.

statement
of
this

is
,
``

was

hungarian-born
british
development
economist.
bauer
is
best
remembered
for
his
opposition

the
most
effective
manner
to
help
developing
countries

is
through

life
==
bauer
was
born
péter
tamás
bauer
in
budapest
,
austria-hungary
,
in
<year>.
his
family
was
jewish.
he
studied
law
in
budapest
before
embarking
for
england
in
<year>
to
study
economics
at
gonville
and
caius
college
,
cambridge
,
from
which
he
graduated
in
<year>.
after
a
brief
period
in
the
private
sector
working
for
guthrie
&
co.
,
a
london-based
merchant
house
that
conducted
business
in
the
far
east
,
bauer
spent
most
of
his
career
at
the
london
school
of
economics.
bauer
started
teaching
there
in
<year>
and
retired
in
<year>
as
emeritus
professor
of
economics.
with
the
support
of
his
friend
and
admirer
prime
minister
margaret
thatcher
,
he
was
created
a
life
peer
as
baron
bauer
,
of
market
ward
in
the
city
of
cambridge
on
<day>.
lord
bauer
was
also
a
fellow
of
the
british
academy
and
a
member
of
the
mont
pelerin
society
,
which
was
founded
by
his
friend
friedrich
hayek.
in
<year>
,
bauer
received
an
honorary
doctoral
degree
at
universidad
francisco
marroquin
for
his
contributions
to
economics.
in
<year>
,
he
won
the
friedman
prize
for
advancing
liberty
;
as
part
of

,
the
cato
institute
cited
his
courage
in
espousing
an
approach
almost
universally
opposed
in
post-world
war
ii
international
economic
circles.
bauer
told
london
's
daily
telegraph
:
``
i
am
truly
honoured.
i
have
long
admired
the
cato
institute
and
milton
friedman
,
and
recognition
by
both
could
not
be
more
delightful.
''
he
died
in
london
,
england
,
on

==
contributions
to
economics
==
nearly
all
of
bauer
's
contributions
concerned
development
economics
,
international
development
and
foreign
aid.
bauer
sought
to
convince
other
development
experts
that
central
planning
,
foreign
aid
,
price
controls
,
and
protectionism
perpetuate
poverty
rather
than
eliminate
it
,
and
that
the
growth
of
government
intervention
politicises
economic
life
and
reduces
individual
freedom.bauer
influenced
thinking
about
the
determinants
of
economic
advance.
for
example
,
the
world
bank
,
in
its
<year>
world
development
report
,
reflected
the
point
of
view
bauer
had
been
advocating
for
years
,
stating
that
the
notion
that
``
good
advisers
and
technical
experts
would
formulate
good
policies
,
which
good
governments
would
then
implement
for
the
good
of
society
''
was
outdated
:
the
institutional
assumptions
implicit
in
this
world
view
were
,
as
we
all
realize
today
,
too
simplistic
...
.
governments
embarked
on
fanciful
schemes.
private
investors
,
lacking
confidence
in
public
policies
or
in
the
steadfastness
of
leaders
,
held
back.
powerful
rulers
acted
arbitrarily.
corruption
became
endemic.
development
faltered
,
and
poverty
endured.
for
bauer
,
the
essence
of
development
was
the
expansion
of
individual
choices
,
and
the
role
of
the
state
to
protect
life
,
liberty
and
property
so
that
individuals
can
pursue
their
own
goals
and
desires.
limited
government
,
not
central
planning
,
was
his
mantra.
he
argued
that
``
the
exponents
of
western
guilt
...
patronize
the
third
world
by
suggesting
that
its
economic
fortunes
past
,
present
,
and
prospective
,
are
determined
by
the
west
;
that
past
exploitation
by
the
west
explains
third
world
backwardness
...
and
that
(
their
)
economic
future
depends
largely
on
western
donations.
''
bauer
placed
himself
in
the
tradition
of
libertarians.
in
his
many
articles
and
books
,
including
dissent
on
development
,
bauer
overturned
many
of
the
commonly
held
beliefs
of
development
economics.
he
refuted
the
idea
that
poverty
is
self-perpetuating
and
showed
that
central
planning
and
large-scale
public
investment
are
not
preconditions
for
growth.
he
criticised
the
idea
that
the
disadvantaged
could
not
and
would
not
save
for
the
future
,
or
that
they
had
no
motivation
to
improve
their
condition.
he
opposed
``
compulsory
saving
,
''
which
he
preferred
to
call
``
special
taxation
,
''
and
,
like
modern
supply-side
economists
,
stressed
the
detrimental
effects
of
high
taxes
on
economic
activity.
bauer
also
saw
that
government-directed
investment
funded
by
``
special
taxation
''
would
increase
``
inequality
in
the
distribution
of
power.
''
bauer
's
experiences
in
malaya
(
now
west
malaysia
)
in
the
late
<year>s
and
in
west
africa
influenced
his
views
on
the
importance
of
individual
effort
by
small
landowners
and
traders
in
moving
from
subsistence
to
a
higher
standard
of
living.
bauer
recognised
the
importance
of
the
informal
sector
and
advocated
the
``
dynamic
gains
''
from
international
trade
–
that
is
,
the
net
gains
that
result
from
exposure
to
new
ideas
,
new
methods
of
production
,
new
products
,
and
new
people.
he
demonstrated
that
trade
barriers
,
and
restrictive
immigration
and
population
policies
deprive
countries
of
those
gains.
for
bauer
,
government-to-government
aid
was
neither
necessary
nor
sufficient
for
development
,
and
may
actually
hinder
it.
the
danger
of
aid
,
according
to
bauer
,
is
that
it
increases
the
power
of
government
,
leads
to
corruption
,
misallocates
resources
,
and
erodes
civil
society.
bauer
also
debunked
what
ralph
raico
has
termed
the
``
timeless
approach
''
to
history.
a
person
commits
this
fallacy
when
he
ignores
the
various
events
and
preconditions
which
existed
before
and
acted
as
prerequisites
for
the
event
or
state
of
affairs
being
analysed.
quoting
raico
:
``
rejecting
the
'timeless
approach
'
to
economic
development
,
bauer
has
accentuated
the
many
centuries
required
for
economic
growth
in
the
western
world
,
and
the
interplay
of
various
cultural
factors
that
were
its
precondition

the

of

was

the

writer

stein
was
known
as
a
pragmatic
conservative
and
was
referred
to
as
``
a
liberal
's
conservative
and
a
conservative
's
liberal.
''
he
was
the
author
of
the
fiscal
revolution
in
america.
in
one
article
,
stein
wrote
that
the
people
who
wore
an
``
adam
smith
necktie
''
did
so
to
make
a
statement
of
their
devotion
to
the
idea
of
free
markets
and
limited
government.
what
stands
out
in
[
smith
's
seminal
work
]
wealth
of
nations
,
however
,
is
that
their
patron
saint
was
not
pure
or
doctrinaire
about
this
idea.
he
viewed
government
intervention
in
the
market
with
great
skepticism.
he
regarded
his
exposition
of
the
virtues
of
the
free
market
as
his
main
contribution
to
policy
,
and
the
purpose
for
which
his
economic
analysis
was
developed.
yet
he
was
prepared
to
accept
or
propose
qualifications
to
that
policy
in
the
specific
cases
where
he
judged
that
their
net
effect
would
be
beneficial
and
would
not
undermine
the
basically
free
character
of
the
system.
in
stein
's
reading
,
the
wealth
of
nations
could
justify
the
food
and
drug
administration
,
the
consumer
product
safety
commission
,
mandatory
employer
health
benefits
,
environmentalism
,
and
``
discriminatory
taxation
to
deter
improper
or
luxurious
behavior.
''
===
stein
's
law
===
stein
propounded
stein
's
law
,
which
he
expressed
in
<year>
as
``
if
something
can
not
go
on
forever
,
it
will
stop.
''
stein
observed
this
logic
in
analyzing
economic
trends
(
such
as
rising
us
federal
debt
in
proportion
to
gdp
,
or
increasing
international
balance
of
payments
deficits
,
in
his
analysis
)
:
if
such
a
process
is
limited
by
external
factors
,
there
is
no
urgency
for
government
intervention
to
stop
it
,
much
less
to
make
it
stop
immediately
,
but
it
will
stop
of
its
own
accord.
a
paraphrase
,
not
attributed
to
stein
,
is
``
trends
that
ca
n't
continue
won't.

buying
meat
for
the
italian
army
fighting
on

russian
front.
on
<day>
,
italy
surrendered
to
the
allies.
italians
had
to
choose
whether
to
join
benito
mussolini
's
newly
formed
italian
social
republic
,
which
was
fascist
,
or
stay
loyal
to
the
king
and
join
the
allied
side.
perlasca
chose
the
latter.
in
budapest
,
he
was
arrested
and
confined
to
a
castle
reserved
for
diplomats.
after
a
few
months
,
he
used
a
medical
pass
that
allowed
him
to
travel
within
hungary
and
he
requested
political
asylum
at
the
spanish
embassy.
he
took
advantage
of
his
status
as
a
veteran
of
the
spanish
war.
he
adopted
the
first
name
of
``
jorge
''
and
,
since
spain
was
neutral
in
the
war
,
he
became
a
free
man.perlasca
worked
with
the
spanish
chargé
d'affaires
,
ángel
sanz
briz
,
and
other
diplomats
of
neutral
states
to
smuggle
jews
out
of
hungary.
the
system
he
devised
consisted
of
furnishing
``
protection
cards
''
which
placed
jews
under
the
guardianship
of
various
neutral
states.
he
helped
jews
find
refuge
in
protected
houses
under
the
control
of
various
embassies
,
which
had
extraterritorial
conventions
that
gave
them
an
equivalent
to
sovereignty.
they
could
provide
asylum
for
jews.when
sanz
briz
was
transferred
from
hungary
to
switzerland
in
november
<year>
,
he
invited
perlasca
to
accompany
him
to
safety.
however
,
perlasca
chose
to
remain
in
hungary.
the
hungarian
government
ordered
the
spanish
embassy
building
and
the
extraterritorial
houses
where
the
jews
took
refuge
to
be
cleared
out.
perlasca
immediately
made
the
false
announcement
that
sanz
briz
was
due
to
return
from
a
short
leave
,
and
that
he
had
been
appointed
his
deputy
for
the
meantime.
throughout
the
winter
,
perlasca
was
active
in
hiding
,
shielding
and
feeding
thousands
of
jews
in
budapest.
he
continued
issuing
safe
conduct
passes
(
initiated
by
sanz
briz
)
,
on
the
basis
of
a
spanish
law
passed
in
<year>
that
granted
citizenship
to
jews
of
sephardic
origin
(
descendants
of
iberian
jews
expelled
from
spain
in
the
late
<integer>th
century
)
.in
december
<year>
,
perlasca
rescued
two
boys
from
being
herded
onto
a
freight
train
in
defiance
of
a
german
lieutenant
colonel
on
the
scene.
the
swedish
diplomat-rescuer
raoul
wallenberg
,
also
present
there
,
later
told
perlasca
that
the
officer
who
had
challenged
him
was
adolf
eichmann.
over
<integer>

,
from
<day>

helped
save
more

about

while

was
posing
as

spanish
consul-general
,
he
learned
of
the
intentions
of
the
ss
and
the
far-right
hungarian
arrow
cross
to
destroy
the
ghetto.
shocked
and
incredulous
,
he
asked
for
a
direct
hearing
with
the
hungarian
interior
minister
,
gábor
vajna
,
and
threatened
him
with
legal
and
economic
measures
against
the
``

citizens
''
(
in
fact
,
a

smaller
number

declared
by
perlasca
as
residents
of

,
unless
he
withdrew
the
plan.
perlasca
also
offered
to
help
vajna
and
his

escape
from

before

reached
