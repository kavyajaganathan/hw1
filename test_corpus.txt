was
an
american
ornithologist
who
specialized
in
the
neotropics.

``
was
widely
considered
the

ornithologist
that

==
biography
==
parker
grew
up
in
lancaster
,
pennsylvania
and
became
interested
in
birdwatching
at
an
early
age.
in
<year>
he
broke
the
north
american
big
year
record
(
seeing
more
species
of
birds
in
a
year
than
anyone
before
)
.
in
that
year
he
enrolled
at
the
university
of
arizona
and
began
to
accompany
ornithological
expeditions
to
south
america
,
particularly
with
louisiana
state
university.
he
moved
to
baton
rouge
and
was
associated
with
lsu
for
the
rest
of
his
life
(
becoming
a
fanatical
supporter
of
lsu
basketball
)
.
he
supported
himself
by
leading
birding
tours
,
especially
for
victor
emanuel
nature
tours
,
until
the
last
few
years
of
his
life
,
when
he
went
to
work
for
conservation
international.
==
identification
skills
==
according
to
zimmer
(
<year>
)
,
``
voice
,
microhabitat
,
and
behavior
are
the
keys
[
to
identification
]
in
neotropical
forests
,
and
ted
was
not
only
the
first
to
recognize
this
(
his
seminal
paper
on
foliage-gleaner
identification
that
appeared
in
the
april
<year>
issue
of
continental
birdlife
should
be
required
reading
for
all
students
of
tropical
birding
)
,
but
also
honed
his
discrimination
of
these
essential
cues
to
a
finer
degree
than
anyone
else.
''
zimmer
adds
that
as
knowledge
of
these
matters
was
limited
,
``
[
m
]
any
field
problems…
took
weeks
of
patient
effort
for
ted
to
work
out
for
himself.
''
if
another
ornithologist
played
parker
a
tape
of
an
unknown
bird
,
he
could
usually
recognize
it
and
could
often
identify
other
species
in
the
background
noise.
he
might
then
,
by
his
knowledge
of
bird
ranges
,
state
where
the
tape
had
been
made—zimmer
gives
the
example
of
``
south
bank
of
the
amazon
between
the
rios
madeira
and
tapajos
''
.he
could
identify
bird
calls
and
songs
even
in
the
presence
of
many
other
birds
,
as
when
the
bird
was
a
member
of
a
mixed-species
flock.
on
more
than
one
occasion
,
he
identified
a
bird
new
to
him
by
its
call
,
since
he
recognized
the
genus
and
knew
what
species
lived
in
the
area.
once
,
hearing
a
recording
of
a
dawn
chorus
in
bolivia
,
he
realized
that
one
of
the
sounds
was
an
antwren
of
the
genus
herpsilochmus—but
since
he
knew
all
the
sounds
of
those
birds
,
he
knew
he
was
hearing
a
previously
unknown
species.
the
following
year
,
the
new
species
was
discovered.
the
scale
of
this
knowledge
is
given
by
the
presence
of
over
two
thousand
bird
species
in
the
andes
and
amazon
,
where
parker
did
most
of
his
field
work
;
each
species
typically
has
at
least
three
vocalizations.
he
kept
them
straight
not
only
from
each
other
but
from
the
region
's
monkeys
,
amphibians
,
and
insects
as
well.
==
methods
==
don
stap
describes
parker
's
method
:
walking
slowly
down
a
trail
,
pausing
after
every
step
,
and
watching
and
listening.
in
this
way
he
gained
his
knowledge
of
both
detail
and
``
common
patterns
in
behavior
or
vocalizations
or
community
structure
across
the
continent
''
,
which
led
jon
fjeldså
and
niels
krabbe
to
call
him
``
by
far
the
greatest
specialist
on
the
life
histories
of
neotropical
birds
there
ever
was
''
.
stap
also
notes
that
parker
generally
did
not
shoot
birds
for
study
,
a
normal
method
of
field
ornithology.when
leading
tours
,
parker
would
lure
flocks
in
by
recording
their
sounds
as
he
heard
them
and
then
immediately
playing
the
tape
back
;
he
would
predict
where
the
flock
would
come
into
sight
and
arrange
his
clients
to
give
each
a
good
view.
the
flock
would
appear
as
predicted.
==

shared
his
knowledge
with

published
extensively
,

over

,
<integer>
recordings
to
the
macaulay
library
of
natural
sounds
at
the
cornell
laboratory
of
ornithology.
when
he
went
to
work
for
conservation
international
,
he
conceived
of
an
interdisciplinary
program
to
provide
scientific
information
in
south
america
's
conservation
crises.
this
rapid
assessment
program
has
led
to
the
creation
of

focusing
his
efforts
on
research
in
the
field
of

,
which
has
been
highly
successful

he
recalls
how
difficult
it
was
to
decide
to
fly
a
primate
for
the
first
time.
``
it
was
obvious
to
us
that
we
had
to
fly
monkeys
if
we
wanted
to
resolve
the
big
questions
about
manned
space
flight.
but
our
expertise
was
with
other
animals
,
like
mice
and
dogs
,
so
we
did
n't
dare
to
fly
monkeys
for
a
long
time.
''
close
contacts
with
american
primate
researchers
were
valuable

erich
hans
apel
was
born
in
judenbach
,
a
small
town
in
the
franconian
forest
which
had
once
benefited
from
its
position
as
a
staging
post
on
a
major
trade
route
,
but
which
had
lost
out
commercially
following
the
construction
of
a
railway
line
providing
a
direct
link
from
leipzig
to
nuremberg.
apel
's
father
was
a
mechanical
engineer
:
his
mother
worked
in
the
garments
industry.
he
attended
school
in
nearby
sonneberg
and
steinach
,
but
left
school
in
<year>
in
order
to
embark
on
an
apprenticeship
at
the
neuhaus
porcelain
factory
in
toolmaking
and
mechanical
engineering.
the
ruling
nazi
party
was
popular
in
the
region
and
in
<year>
he
joined
the
deutsches
jungvolk
youth
organisation.
however
,
it
was
found
that
the
sixteen
year
old
disrupted
the
``
mind-numbingly
dull
drill
exercises
''
(
``
der
stumpfsinnige
drill
''
)
,
and
he
was
thrown
out
after
nine
months
because
of
his
``
negative
attitude
''
to
the
quasi-military
exercises
in
which
the
boys
were
expected
to
participate.
after
completing
his
apprenticeship
in
<year>
he
stayed
on
at
the
neuhaus
factory
as
a
toolmaker
and
designer
till
<year>.
then
,
between
<year>
and
<year>
,
he
attended
the
engineering
academy
at
nearby
ilmenau
,
emerging
with
a
degree
in
mechanical
engineering.

directly
after

apel

conscripted
into

becoming
a
member
of
infantry
reserve
battalion
<integer>
,
based
in
gotha.
around
this
time
world
war

broke
out.
however
,
on
<day>
apel
was
ordered
to
the
weapons
agency
's
research
facility
at
peenemünde
on
germany
's
northern
coast.
the
head
of
the
facility
was
the
charismatic
rocketry
expert
,
wernher
von
braun.
apel
seems
to
have
been
in
his
element.
a
contemporary
later
recalled
that
he
worked
from
<decimal>
till
<decimal>
,
like
everyone
else
,
but
then
in
the
evenings
he
retreated
to
his
bedroom
in
a
nearby
hostel
,
in
order
to
work
on
proposals
for
improvements.
his
speciality
was
the
hydraulic
systems
for
the
rockets.
he
was
tireless
in
his
work
of
calculation
,
measuring
and
modelling.
he
seems
to
have
made
a
good
impression
,
since
in
august
<year>
he
was
relieved
of
all
further
obligations
regarding
military
service.
in
november
<year>
he
was
appointed
to
the
position
of
plant
engineer
and
assistant
to
the
facility
director.
he
was
totally
uninterested
in
politics
,
never
joining
the
party
,
and
regarded
by
colleagues
as
a
dedicated
engineer
,
body
and
soul<decimal>
october
<year>
was
apel
's
twenty-fifth
birthday.
coincidentally
,
he
was
able
to
spent
the
day
as
a
witness
to
the
first
launch
anywhere
in
the
world
of
a
long-distance
rocket
,
the
so-called
(
at
this
stage
)
a4.
the
launch
took
place
at
<decimal>
and
everything
worked
perfectly
,
the
rocket
attaining
a
speed
of
mach
<decimal>
,
a
height
of
<integer>
kilometres
(
<integer>
mi
)
,
and
a
horizontal
distance
of
<integer>
kilometres
(
<integer>
mi
)
.
at
the
start
of
<year>
apel
was
promoted
again
,
despite
his
young
age
becoming
head
of
one
of
the
many
development
departments
at
the
peenemünde
army
research
facility.
shortly
after
this
he
mentioned
to
as
group
of
colleagues
what
a
wretched
business
it
was
that
the
thing
should
explode
in
the
middle
of
a
city.
his
boss
,
walter
thiel
,
came
to
hear
of
the
comment
and
called
him
aside
,
``
apel
,
you
should
have
joined
the
medical
service
:
you
're
too
soft
for
the
work
here
''
.
however
,
there
is
no
indication
that
apel
's
comment
adversely
affected
his
career
prospects
:
the
researchers
at
peenemünde
saw
themselves
as
an
elite
team
engaged
in
vital
work
,
and
the
only
realistic
alternative
career
path
would
have
led
him
back
to
the
military
frontline.during
<year>
it
became
clear
that
the
british
knew
about
the
research
facility
at
peenemünde.
with
their
us
allies
they
launched
a
succession
of
bombing
raids
to
destroy
it
,
starting
in
august
<year>.
most
of
the
<integer>
people
killed
at
peenemünde
in
the
first
bombing
raid
,
on
<integer>
august
,
were
forced
labourers
,
but
the
dead
also
included
erich
apel
's
boss
,
walter
thiel
and
his
family.
by
that
time
,
however
,
apel
himself
was
far
away
,
transferred
in
april
<year>
with
his
own
team
of
assembly
specialists
and
administrators
to
the
linke-hofmann-werke
(
lhw
)
plant
in
breslau
(
as
wrocław
was
known
)
before
<year>
)
.
breslau
was
traditionally
a
centre
for
railway
production
and
lhw
was
traditionally
a
manufacturer
of
railway
locomotives
and
rolling
stock
,
but
during
the
war
its
sophisticated
engineering
capabilities
were
also
being
adapted
to
produce
components
and
sub-assemblies
for
the
rocket
,
which
government
propaganda
was
by
now
identifying
as
the
``
vergeltungswaffe
<integer>
''
(
``
retribution
weapon
<integer>
''
/
v<integer>
)
.
as
the
continuing
bombing
raids
at
the
peenemünde
army
research
center
had
their
effect
through
<year>
and
<year>
,
the
lhw
plant
became
the
assembly
location
for
the
v<integer>
rockets.
in
<day>
,
at
the
request
of
the
lhw
management
,
erich
apel
was
released
from
his
employment
contract
with
the
army
high
command
weapons
agency.
he
was
now
employed
directly
as
chief
engineer
and
assistant
to
the
technical
director
at
lhw.by
the
end
of
<year>
the
war
was
coming
home
to
germany.
lhw
now
outsourced

rocket
production
to
a
firm
called
``
peterbau

''
in
kleinbodungen
near
nordhausen.
with
the
assembly
contract
they
sent
erich
apel
,
who
with
effect
from
january
<year>
became
technical
director
of
peterbau
gmbh.
apel
's
resolute
determination
to
avoid
politics
now
seemed
to
catch
up
with
him
,
since
the
new
location
for
rocket
assembly
was
part
of
the
vast
underground
factory
at
the
mittelbau-dora
concentration
camp.
conditions
were
so
dreadful
that
at
least
one
commentator
has
suggested
that
the
v<integer>
rockets
found
more
victims
among
the
slave
labourers
engaged
in
constructing
the
underground
factory
and
in
working
on
the
rockets
than
among
the
citizens
of
london
,
the
intended
target
of
the
finished
rockets.
even
if
erich
apel
had
nothing
to
do
with
setting
up
and
running
the
vast
deadly
forced
labour
infrastructure
,
as
the
engineer
responsible
for
the
rockets
he
was
naturally
associated
with
it.
as
nazi
germany
collapsed
militarily
and
politically
during
the
first
part
of
<year>
,
apel
succeeded
in
getting
back
to
his
home
village
of
judenbach.
like
millions
of
his
compatriots
he
was
determined
to
make
a
clean
break
with
the
past.
===
soviet
occupation
zone
===
war
ended
,
formally
,
in
may
<year>.
the
entire
southern
region
of
germany
had
been
liberated
by
the
united
states
army
,
but
the
victorious
powers
had
already
agreed
a
partition
of
the
western
two
thirds
of
the
country
into
four
military
occupation
zones.
after
the
americans
had
withdrawn
to
their
agreed
positions
judenbach
was
included
in
the
middle
portion
of
germany
that
would
now
be
administered
as
the
soviet
occupation
zone.
initially
apel
worked
on
the
local
farms.
on
<day>
he
enrolled
on
the
``
new
teachers
''
programme.
with
millions
of
working
age
germans
dead
or
in
prison
of
war
camps
,
there
was
a
desperate
shortage
of
teachers
,
and
the
scheme
,
implemented
with
varying
levels
of
effectiveness
in
the
various
occupation
zones
,
was
designed
to
select
those
appropriately
educated
individuals
who
were
thought
to
be
not
excessively
tainted
by
nazi
involvement
,
to
undergo
a
rapid
``
re-education
''
and
set
to
work
educating
school-age
children.
at
the
same
time
he
both
studied
and
taught
,
till
<day>
,
at
the
professional
business
academy
in
nearby
steinach.in
january
<year>
erich
apel
joined
a
political
party
,
choosing
the
centre-left
social
democratic
party
(
``
sozialdemokratische
partei
deutschlands
''
/
spd
)
.
four
months
later
,
the

merged
with
the
communist
party
to
form
the
new
socialist
unity
party
(
``
sozialistische
einheitspartei
deutschlands
''
/
sed
)
.
the
merger
was
presented
as
a
way
to
prevent
divisions
on
the
political
left
from
opening
up
opportunities
for
right
wing
populists
to
take
control
as
had
happened
after
<year>.
in
reality
it
never
took
effect
except
in
the
soviet
zone
,
where
it
received
sustained
practical
backing
from
the
military
administration.
the
political
development
was
not
one
for
which
apel
could
muster
much
enthusiasm
,
and
in
common
with
many
spd
members
he
was
not
one
of
those
``
volunteering
''
to
sign
his
party
membership
over
to
the
new

(
though
he
was
accepted

on
<day>
apel
was
``
picked
up
''
by
the
soviet
authorities.
they
showed
no
interest
in
his
association
with
forced
labour
at
the
underground
rocket
factory
at
mittelbau-dora.
but
they
were
nevertheless
interested
in
the
factory
;
and
they
did
make
him
an
offer
which
,
for
a
range
of
practical
reasons
,
he
was
almost
certainly
in
no
position
to
refuse.
the
soviets
invited
him
to
work
with
them
as
chief
engineer
and
representative
of
the
(
former
)
factory
management
at
the
soviet
technical

of
nordhausen
(
which
had

,
adjacent
to
the

underground
rocket
plant.soviet
interest
in

was
fully
shared
by
the

during
the
chaotic
closing
weeks
of
the

wernher
von

had
traveled
to
nordhausen

met
with
apel
,
offering
to
take
him
to
america
after
the
military
defeat
which
by
now
everyone
saw
as
inevitable.
von
braun
was
keen
,
as
far
as
possible
,
to
keep
his
full
team
with
him.
but
his
specialist
in
rocket
hydraulics
turned
him
down.
apel
did
not
want
to
volunteer
for
further
work
in
the
weapons

,
across
the
soviet
occupation

,
in
the
early

of
the
morning
technicians

engineers
from
the

were
visited
by
soviet
officers

each
accompanied
by

a

instruction
was
read
out
:
``

till
now
apel

involved
living

not

the

to
``

was
reached
by

indicated
that
during

in

it

erich

returned
on
<day>.
the
soviet
occupation
zone
had
been
relaunched
in
october
<year>
as
the
soviet
sponsored
german
democratic
republic
(
east

there
was
no
call
,
in
east
germany
,
for
specialist
expertise
in
weapons
and
rocketry.
other
branches
of
heavy
industry
remained
in
place
,
however.
just
four
months
after
getting
back
,
erich
apel
was
working
as
a
chief
engineer
and
department
head
at
the
east
german
ministry
for
machinery
construction.
promotion
to
a
technical
directorship
followed
in
april
<year>.
in
november
<year>
he
became
a
deputy
minister
in
the
department
,
working
under
heinrich
rau.he
owed
his
rapid
advancement
in
the
new
state
to
its
leader
,
walter
ulbricht.
after
years
under
military
occupation
which
in
many
ways
placed
soviet
well-being
ahead
of
german
reconstruction
,
ulbricht
had
narrowly
survived
the
<year>
uprising
and
was
now
keen
to
demonstrate
that
under
soviet
sponsorship
it
was
possible
to
create
in
east
germany
a
fully
functioning
socialist
state.
for
that
he
needed
technical
experts
and
talented
administrators.
apel
was
both.
an
important
political
ally
and
sponsor
was
fritz
selbmann.
after
his
six
years
in
the
soviet
union
,
apel
(
like
selbmann
)
,
was
a
convinced
proponent
of
a
``
planned
economy
''
.
the
choice
was
one
between
``
rationalty
''
(
vernunft
)
and
``
chaos
''
.
it
was
already
apparent
that
in
west
germany
free
market
capitalism
was
giving
rise
to
far
more
rapid
economic
growth
than
anything
happening
in
east
germany.
the
lesson
to
be
drawn
was
that
economic
planning
had
to
be
undertaken
competently
and
in
microscopic
detail
by
the
government.
political
leadership
was
needed.in
june
<year>
,
already
a
junior
government
minister
,
apel
became
a
candidate
for
party
membership.
membership
was
granted
in
march
<year>.
slightly
more
than
one
year
later
,
in
july
<year>
,
he
became
a
candidate
for
central
committee
membership.
in
july
<year>
erich
apel
became
one
of
approximately
<integer>
members
of
the
powerful
party
central
committee.
under
the
leninist
constitutional
structure
in
place
,
the
central
committee
exercised
a
far
tighter
degree
of
control
than
government
ministers
or
the
national
parliament
(
volkskammer
)
.
it
was
therefore
by
most
reckoning
a
promotion
when
on
<day>
erich
apel
resigned
his
ministerial
position
and
accepted
a
position
as
head
of
the
newly
created
economic
commission
of
the
central
committee
's
politburo.
in
<year>
he
also
became
a
member
of
the
volkskammer
,
in
which
capacity
he
chaired
the
parliamentary
economic
committee.the
economic
challenges
facing
east
germany
were
already
formidable
by
<year>.
the
mandate
walter
ulbricht
gave
to
the
new
economic
commission
was
summed
up
in
the
mantra
which
the
leader
liked
to
repeat.
east
germany
should
``
overtake
without
catching
up
''
(
``
überholen
ohne
einzuholen
''
)
.
east
germans
must
be
able
to
eat
more
butter
and
meat
than
west
germans.
one
day
they
must
be
able
to
travel
in
faster
cars
and
live
in
better
apartments.
this
must
be
accomplished
without
having
to
copy
``
capitalist
production
methods
''
.
erich
apel
must
make
it
happen
,
not
``
someday
...
never
''
,
but
by
creating
and
following
a
plan.
if
it
was
a
dream
,
it
was
a
dream
in
which
many
comrades
evidently
believed.
in
july
<year>
apel
was
promoted
to
candidate
membership
of
the
politburo
and
secretaryship
of
the
central
committee.
there
were
other
appointments
which
combined
to
stress
his
importance
in
the
wider
government
project.
in
<year>
he
received
a
doctorate
in
return
for
a
dissertation
on
the
so-called
east
german
chemistry
programme.the
``
chemistry
programme
''
was
a
seven-year
plan
,
launched
in
<year>
under
the
widely
communicated
motto
``
chemistry
gives
us
bread
,
welfare
and
beauty
''
(
``
chemie

brot
,
wohlstand
und

''
)
,
and
designed
to
double
chemicals
production
by
<year>
,
making
it
the
country
's
second
largest
industrial
sector
after
mechanical
engineering.
the
project
was
closely
identified
with
erich
apel
,
whose
intellectual
brilliance
marked
him
,
and
the
project
,
out
for
success.
but
reality
got
in
the
way
of
the
targets.
reparations
extracted
by
the
soviets
had
bled
the
country
of
its
capacity
to
rebuild
and
maintain
the
infrastructure
necessary
to
support
the
east
german
government
's
economic
aspirations.
cut
off
by
international
political
rivalries
from
western
and
world
markets
,
the
nation
continued
to
be
dependent
on
deliveries
of
vital
raw
materials
from
the
soviet
union
,
and
the
partnership
with
the
soviets
,
even
at
the
height
of
the
cold
war
,
was
far
less
fraternal
than
would
have
been
assumed
at
the
time
in
the
west.
recently
discovered
documents
indicate
that
even
in
<year>
moscow
agreed
to
deliver
to
the
german
democratic
republic
only
around
half
the
raw
materials
which
the
east
german
economic
plan
for
<year><integer>
called
for.
one
solution
was
to
try
and
select
trading
partners
according
to
commercial
criteria
and
not
purely
according
to
political
dogma.
the
economic
blockade
dividing
east
germany
from
the
west
was
largely
self-imposed
:
between
<year>
and
<year>
apel
was
able
to
oversee
a
modest
trend
whereby
the
proportion
of
east
germany
's
foreign
trade
with
west
rose
from
<integer>
%
to
<integer>
%
of
the
total.
but
more
than
half
of
the
country
's
trade
was
reported
in
<year>
to
be
with
the
soviet
union
,
conducted
on
terms
favourable
to
moscow
and
disadvantageous
to
east
germany
,
applying
set
prices
that
were
well
below
``
world
market
prices
''
,
both
for
exports
and
for
imports.in
<year>
otto
grotewohl
and
willi
stoph
took
over
as
chairman
of
the
council
of
ministers.
at
the
time
there
were
some
who
saw
stoph
as
walter
ulbricht
's
heir
apparent.
a
level
of
rivalry
within
the
party
central
committee
was
normal
,
but
between
apel
and
stoph
there
quickly
emerged
a
particularly
intense
mutual
antagonism.
to
the
extent
that
both
men
were
responsible
for
delivering
a
better
future
for
the
people
there
was
an
inherent
overlap
between
their
public
profiles.
stoph
never
missed
a
chance
to
highlight
a
failure
to
meet
planned
objectives
or
to
criticise
apel
's
actions
and
utterances.
pressure
also
increased
from
moscow
where
nikita
khrushchev
fell
from
power
in
october
<year>.
leonid
brezhnev
,
the
new
party
secretary
in
moscow
,
condemned
his
predecessor
's
``
failures
of
economic
leadership
''
.
there
were
a
number
of
rapid
practical
changes.
soviet
wheat
deliveries
to
east
germany
planned
for
<year>
were
cut
back
to
<integer>
,
<integer>
tonnes
,
a
third
of
the
annual
quantity
in
existing
plans.
within
the
east
german
leadership
apel
had
always
been
able
to
count
on
backing
for
his
reforms
from
walter
ulbricht
,
but
the
changes
in
moscow
meant
that
ulbricht
's
driving
priority
had
was
now
to
secure
his
own
position.
back
in
january
<year>
ulbricht
had
stunned
colleagues
,
under
the
influence
of
apel
,
announcing
a
<integer>-degree
reversal
on
economic
policy.
``
we
need
economics
to
trump
politics
''
(
``

brauchen

''
)
.
there
was
talk
of
revitalising
the
market
and
allowing
private
trade
-
subject
to
a
restrictive
framework
-
and
of
moving
society
away
from
a
semi-military
footing
towards
a
civil
one.
that
had
been
in
<year>
,
before
the
fall
of
khrushchev.
but
now
the
leader
was
ready
for
another
<integer>
degree
reversal
over
economic
policy.on
<day>
erich
apel
was
due
to
sign
a
new
economic
agreement
with
the
soviet
union
covering
the
period
<year>-<year>.
earlier
that
year
he
had
traveled
to
moscow
with
walter
ulbricht
to
finalise
the
terms.
apel
was
not
in
favour
of
signing
the
agreement
that
the
comrades
in
moscow
had
imposed
,
but
he
had
been
opposed
by
alfred
neumann
,
chairman
of
the
people
's
economic
council
and
a
moscow
loyalist.
more
importantly
,
he
had
been
over-ruled
by
walter
ulbricht.
early
that
morning
the
telephone
rang
in
apel
's
office
at
the
ministry
in
east
berlin.
willi
stoph
wanted
a
word.
there
was
no
reply.
erich
apel

while
seated
at
his
desk
,
had
taken
his
own
life.
a

from
his

at

the
east
german
signature
on
the
trade
deal
with
the
soviets
would
be
that
of
alfred
neumann.
news
of
apel
's
death
was
held
back
till
after
the
soviet
signatory
,
trade
minister
nikolai
patolichev
had
left
town
,
later
that
day.there
were
those
who
believed
erich
apel
had
been
murdered
,
in
the
context
of
an
increasingly
intense
power
struggle
between
politburo
members
as
walter
ulbricht
's
period
in
power
was
seen
to
be
coming
to
an
end.
ulbricht
himself
ordered
the
ministry
for
state
security
to
investigate
apel
's
death
,
though
later
commentators
found
the
aspects
of
the
investigation
``
uncharacteristically
sloppy
''
.
on
the
other
hand
,
west
berlin
's
mayor
,
willy
brandt
was
never
in

that
erich

death
had
been
a
suicide
,
performed
in
protest
over
the
soviet
union
's
continuing
exploitation
of
east

brandt
reacted
with
a
cryptic
prophesy
:
``
he

==
legacy
==
krag
is
widely
recognised
as
one
of
the
greatest
politicians
of
all
time
in
denmark.
he
was
in
the
front
line
of
politics
for
<integer>
years
,
holding
high
ministerial
offices
for
most
of
that
time.
he
managed
to
raise
denmark
's
profile
on
the
world
stage
,
striking
up
strong
relationships
with
fellow
european
leaders
as
well
as
american
presidents
kennedy
and
johnson.
his
list
of
political
achievements
is
also
one
of
the
most
impressive
,
overseeing
one
of
the
longest
periods
of
economic
expansion
in
danish
history.
however
,
his
largest
achievement
,
and
the
one
he
himself
was
most
proud
of
,
was
taking
denmark
into
the
european
economic
community
in
<year>.
with
that
task
accomplished
he
felt
he
could
retire
at
a
high
point.
krag
was
at
one
and
the
same
time
one
of
the
most
charismatic
and
withdrawn
danish
politicians
ever.
he
never
enjoyed
the
attention
to
which
he
had
to
subject
himself
,
and
many
people
found
him
rather
arrogant.
according
to
his
most
thorough
(
and
quite
sympathetic
)
biographer
(
bo
lidegaard
,
krag
i-ii
,
<year>/<year>
)
he
never
truly
settled
into
the
role
as
a
politician
,
always
considering
himself
on
the
way
'to
somewhere
else'.
he
had
always
dreamed
of
holding
the
position
of
governor
of
the
national
bank
of
denmark.
only
when
he
had
definitively
quit
politics
in
<year>
did
he
realise
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
achieve
this
goal.
in
the
danish
tv
series
krøniken
(
<year>–<year>
)
he
was
portrayed
by
the
actor
lars
mikkelsen.
==
private
life
==
krag
had
a
difficult
private
life.
he
was
married
twice
and
had
a
son
(

christian
born

and
a
daughter
,
astrid
helene
``

''
(

,
by
his
second
wife
,
the
famous
actress
helle
virkner
,
but
also
another
child
outside
of
wedlock.
both
his
marriages
ended
in
divorce
,
largely
due
to
his
own
infidelity.
during
his
time
in
politics
,
he
already
struggled
with
alcoholism
,
an
addiction
that
became
more
pronounced
after
his
retirement.
he
died
of
heart
failure
in
skiveren
,
denmark
at
the
age
of

he
was
an
atheist.

==
in
<year>
,
stane
dolanc
,
the
slovenian
representative
to
the
collective
presidency
of
yugoslavia
,
retired.
the
slovenian
communist
party
,
aware
of
upcoming
democratisation
,
decided
to
organize
elections
between
two
candidates
for
the
position.
drnovšek
,
until
then
rather
unknown
to
the
public
,
defeated
marko
bulc
,
the
party
's
preferred
candidate.
the
communist
leaderships
of
other
yugoslav
republics
did
not
agree
with
this
new
way
of
selecting
the
representative
to
the
collective
presidency
,
so
the
slovenian
republic
parliament
had
to
confirm
the
result
of
the
elections.
drnovšek
served
as
chairman
of
the
collective
presidency
from
<year>–<integer>.
while
he
was
chairman
of
the
presidency
,
he
was
also
chairman
of
the
non-aligned
movement
and
the
commander
of
the
yugoslav
people
's
army.
until
the
end
of
communist
rule
he
was
an
active
member
of
the
communist
party.
after
the
democratic
changes
in
slovenia
,
the
country
seceded
from
yugoslavia.
following
the
ten
day
war
,
drnovšek
used
his
position
in
the
collective
presidency
to
help
mediate
the
brioni
agreement
and
to
negotiate
a
peaceful
withdrawal
of
yugoslav
army
from
slovenia.
==
prime
minister
of
slovenia
==
in
<year>
,
after
a
government
crisis
in
the
demos
coalition
,
which
had
won
the
first
democratic
elections
in
slovenia
in
<year>
and
led
the
country
to
independence
,
drnovšek
became
the
second
prime
minister
of
independent
slovenia.
he
was
chosen
as
a
compromise
candidate
and
an
expert
in
economic
policy.
his
bi-partisan
government
was
supported
both
by
the
left
and
centrist
wing
of
the
dissolved
demos
coalition
(
the
social
democratic
party
of
slovenia
,
the
democratic
party
and
the
greens
of
slovenia
)
and
by
three
parties
that
derived
from
organizations
of
the
former
communist
regime
(
the
liberal
democratic
party
,
the
party
of
democratic
reform
and
the
socialist
party
of
slovenia
)
.
shortly
afterwards
,
drnovšek
was
elected
president
of
the
liberal
democratic
party
(
liberalno
demokratska
stranka
–
lds
)
,
the
legal
successor
of
the
association
of
socialist
youth
of
slovenia
(
zveza
socialistične
mladine
slovenije
–
zsms
)
,
the
youth
fraction
of
the
communist
party
of
slovenia.
in
<year>
,
the
liberal
democratic
party
under
drnovšek
's
leadership
won
the
parliamentary
elections
,
but
due
to
a
high
fragmentation
of
the
popular
vote
had
to
ally
itself
with
other
parties
in
order
to
form
a
stable
government.
despite
a
politically
turbulent
mandate
(
in
<year>
,
the
social
democratic
party
of
slovenia
left
the
coalition
)
,
the
party
gained
votes
in
<year>
,
remaining
the
largest
party
in
the
government.
nevertheless
,
drnovšek
barely
secured
himself
a
third
term
in
office
after
a
failed
attempt
to
ally
himself
with
the
slovenian
national
party.
in
<year>
,
the
liberal
democracy
of
slovenia
formed
a
coalition
government
with
the
populist
slovenian
people
's
party
which
finally
enabled
drnovšek
to
serve
a
third
term
in
office.
he
headed
the
government
until
may
<year>
,
when
he
stepped
down
due
to
disagreements
with
the
slovenian
people
's
party.
after
less
than
six
months
in
opposition
,
drnovšek
returned
to
power
in
the
autumn
of
<year>
,
after
his
party
gained
a
clear
victory
in
the
parliamentary
elections.
drnovšek
's
governments
guided
slovenia
's
political
and
economic
reconstruction.
he
successfully
tackled
the
twin
tasks
of
reorienting
slovenia
's
trade
away
from
the
wreckage
of
the
old
yugoslavia
towards
the
west
and
replacing
the
ineffective
communist-era
business
model
with
more
market-based
mechanisms.
unlike
the
other
five
former
yugoslav
republics
which
were
run
for
much
of
the
<year>s
by
frequently
authoritarian
presidents
,
slovenia
under
drnovšek
's
premiership
quickly
emerged
from
the
break-up
of
the
federation
as
a
functioning
parliamentary
democracy.
drnovšek
's
political
strategy
was
concentrated
on
broad
coalitions
,
transcending
ideological
and
programmatic
divisions
between
parties.
contrary
to
some
other
former
communist
countries
in
eastern
europe
,
the
economic
and
social
transformation
in
slovenia
pursued
by
drnovšek
's
governments
followed
a
gradualist
approach.drnovšek
was
a
staunch
supporter
of
slovenia
's
entry
in
the
european
union
and
nato
and
was
largely
responsible
for
slovenia
's
successful
bid
for
membership
in
both
of
those
organizations.
as
prime
minister
,
he
was
frequently
active
on
foreign
policy
issues.
on
<day>
,
he
helped
to
arrange
the
first
meeting
of
the
u.s.
president
george
w.
bush
with
the
russian
president
vladimir
putin
,
which
was
held
in
the
upper
carniolan
estate
of
brdo
pri
kranju.
(
bush-putin
<year>
)
in
<year>
,
he
ran
for
president
of
slovenia
,
and
was
elected
in
the
second
round
,
defeating
the
center-right
candidate
barbara
brezigar.
==
president
of
slovenia
and
the
change
in
lifestyle
==
drnovšek
's
presidency
was
highly
controversial.
in
the
first
three
years
in
office
,
he
rarely
appeared
in
public
,
save
for
the
most
important
official
duties.
in
<year>
,
however
,
a
change
of
style
became
visible.
he
launched
several
campaigns
in
foreign
policy
,
such
as
a
failed
humanitarian
mission
to
darfur
and
a
proposal
for
the
solution
of
the
political
crisis
in
kosovo.
on
january
<integer>
,
<year>
,
he
left
the
liberal
democracy
of
slovenia.
shortly
afterwards
,
he
founded
the
movement
for
justice
and
development
and
became
its
first
president.
he
claimed
this
was
not
meant
to
be
a
political
movement
,
but
rather
a
wide
initiative
,
aiming
to
``
raise
human
consciousness
and
make
the
world
a
better
place
''
.
on
june
<integer>
,
<year>
,
he
announced
that
he
would
not
be
running
for
a
second
term
in
an
interview
on
tv
slovenia.
===
conflict
with
the
government
===
the
<year>
legislative
election
brought
further
changes
and
a
political
swing
to
the
right.
janez
janša
,
the
leader
of
a
right-wing
coalition
,
formed
the
new
government.
in
slovenia
,
this
was
the
first
time
after
<year>
that
the
president
and
the
prime
minister
had
represented
opposing
political
factions
for
more
than
a
few
months.
between
<year><integer>
,
the
relationship
between
president
drnovšek
and
janez
janša
,
then
leader
of
the
opposition
,
were
considered
more
than
good
and
in
the
first
year
of
cohabitation
,
no
major
problems
arose.
in
the
beginning
of
his
term
,
drnovšek
,
who
was
ill
with
kidney
cancer
,
stayed
out
of
public
view.
when
he
reemerged
in
late
<year>
he
had
already
changed
his
lifestyle
:
he
had
become
a
vegan
(
though
one
of
his
colleagues
in
a
televised
interview
mentioned
their
regular
<day>
visits
to
a
pizzeria
in
maxi
market
,
ljubljana
)
,
moved
out
of
the
capital
into
the
countryside
,
and
withdrew
from
party
politics
completely
,
ending
his
already
frozen
membership
in
the
liberal
democracy.
drnovšek
's
new
approach
to
politics
prompted
one
political
commentator
to
nickname
him
``
slovenia
's
gandhi
''
.the
relationship
between
drnovšek
and
the
government
quickly
became
tense.
disagreements
began
with
drnovšek
's
initiatives
in
foreign
politics
,
aimed
at
solving
major
foreign
conflicts
,
including
those
in
darfur
and
kosovo.
initially
,
these
initiatives
were
initially
not
openly
opposed
by
the
prime
minister
janez
janša
,
but
were
criticized
by
the
foreign
minister
dimitrij
rupel
,
drnovšek
's
former
collaborator
and
close
political
ally
until
<year>.a
major
clash
between
the
two
happened
in
summer
<year>
,
when
disagreement
arose
over
drnovšek
's
attempt
to
intervene
in
the
darfur
conflict.
the
disagreements
moved
from
issues
of
domestic
politics
in
october
<year>
,
when
drnovšek
publicly
criticised
the
treatment
of
the
strojans
,
a
romani
family
whose
neighborhood
had
forced
them
to
relocate
,
which
in
turn
had
subjected
them
to
police
supervision
and
limitation
of
movement.the
disagreements
however
escalated
when
the
parliamentary
majority
repeatedly
rejected
president
's
candidates
for
the
governor
of
the
bank
of
slovenia
,
beginning
with
the
rejection
of
incumbent
mitja
gaspari.
the
friction
continued
over
the
appointment
of
other
state
official
nominees
,
including
constitutional
court
judges.
although
the
president
's
political
support
suffered
after
his
personal
transformation
,
the
polls
nevertheless
showed
public
backing
of
the
president
against
an
increasingly
unpopular
government.the
tension
reached
its
apex
in
may
<year>
,
when
the
newly
appointed
director
of
the
slovenian
intelligence
and
security
agency
matjaž
šinkovec
unclassified
several
documents
from
the
period
before
<year>
,
revealing
,
among
other
,
that
drnovšek
had
used
secret
service
funds
for
personal
purposes
between
<year><integer>.
the
president
reacted
with
a
harsh
criticism
of
the
government
's
policies
,
accusing
the
ruling
coalition
of
abusing
its
power
for
personal
delegitimations
and
labeled
the
then
current
prime
minister
janez
janša
as
``
the
leader
of
the
negative
guys
''
in
the
last
months
in
office
,
drnovšek
continued
his
attacks
on
prime
minister
janez
janša
,
who
mostly
remained
silent
on
the
issue.
drnovšek
accused
janša
of
``
fostering
proto-totalitarian
tendencies
''
.
he
became
a
blogger
(
janez
d
)
,
signing
his
posts
as
``
janez
d
''
and
expressing
opinions
on
various
issues
from
foreign
policy
,
environmentalism
,
human
relationships
,
religion
,
animal
rights
and
personal
growth.
in
his
last
months
in
office
,
he
withdrew
to
a
reclusive
life
again
,
devoting
his
time
to
the
movement
for
justice
and
development
and
the
popularization
of
his
lifestyle
and
views.
===
lifestyle
changes
===
during
his
time
in
office
as
the
president
of
slovenia
,
he
wrote
and
published
several
books
in
spiritual
philosophy
,
including
misli
o
življenju
in

(
``

''
)
,
and
his
last
one
called
pogovori
or
dialogues.
according
to
his
own
accounts
,
it
took
him
only
two
or
three
weeks
to
write
each
of
his
books
,
due
to
–
in
his
words
–
``
the
higher
consciousness
''
he
was
able
to
access.
his
lifestyle
was
a
mixture
of
elements
from
various
traditions
,
including
hindu
religious
thought
and
the
non-attachment
of
buddhist
philosophy.
he
also
valued
the
indigenous
traditions
of
the
world.
for
example
,
he
was
present
at
the
inauguration
of
evo
morales
,
the
first
native
american
president
of
bolivia
,
and
later
hosted
bolivian
ethnic
musicians
in
the
presidential
palace
in
ljubljana.
after
his
cancer
diagnosis
,
drnovšek
became
a
vegan
and
claimed
that
this
greatly
improved
his
health.because
of
his
new
lifestyle
and
the
content
of
his
books
and
blogs
,
he
was
often
regarded
as
an
adherent
of
the
new
age
movement
,
although
he
rejected
such
a
qualification
as
being
too
narrow.

(

.
his

the

which
he

described
in

early
life

phillips
was
born
at
te
rehunga
near

,
new

,
to
harold
housego

,
a
dairy
farmer
,
and

,
a

and
postmistress.he
left
new
zealand
before
finishing
school
to
work
in
australia
at
a
variety
of
jobs
,
including
crocodile
hunter
and
cinema
manager.
in
<year>
phillips
headed
to
china
,
but
had
to
escape
to
russia
when
japan
invaded
china.
he
travelled
across
russia
on
the
trans-siberian
railway
and
made
his
way
to
united
kingdom
in
<year>
,
where
he
studied
electrical
engineering.
at
the
outbreak
of
world
war
ii
,
phillips
joined
the
royal
air
force
and
was
sent
to
singapore.
when
singapore
fell
,
he
escaped
on
the
troopship
empire
state
,
which
came
under
attack
before
safely
arriving
in
java.
when
java
,
too
,
was
overrun
phillips
was
captured
by
the
japanese
,
and
spent
three
and
a
half
years
interned
in
a
prisoner
of
war
camp
in
the
then
dutch
east
indies
(
now
indonesia
)
.
during
this
period
he
learned
chinese
from
other
prisoners
,
repaired
and
miniaturised
a
secret
radio
,
and
fashioned
a
secret
water
boiler
for
tea
which
he
hooked
into
the
camp
lighting
system.
in
<year>
,
he
was
made
a
member
of
the
order
of
the
british
empire
(
mbe
)
for
his
war
service.
after
the
war
he
moved
to
london
and
began
studying
sociology
at
the
london
school
of
economics
,
because
of
his
fascination
with
prisoners
of
war
's
ability
to
organize
themselves.
but
he
became
bored
with
sociology
and
developed
an
interest
in
keynesian
theory
,
so
he
switched
his
course
to
economics
and
within
eleven
years
was
a
professor
of
economics.
==
economics
career
==
while
a
student
at
the
lse
phillips
used
his
training
as
an
engineer
to
develop
moniac
,
an
analogue
computer
which
used
hydraulics
to
model
the
workings
of
the
british
economy
,
inspiring
the
term
hydraulic
macroeconomics.
it
was
very
well
received
and
phillips
was
soon
offered
a
teaching
position
at
the
lse.
he
advanced
from
assistant
lecturer
in
<year>
to
professor
in
<year>.
his
work
focused
on
british
data
and
observed
that
in
years
when
the
unemployment
rate
was
high
,
wages
tended
to
be
stable
,
or
possibly
fall.
conversely
,
when
unemployment
was
low
,
wages
rose
rapidly.
this
sort
of
pattern
had
been
noticed
earlier
by
irving
fisher
,
but
in
<year>
phillips
published
his
own
work
on
the
relationship
between
inflation
and
unemployment
,
illustrated
by
the
phillips
curve.
soon
after
the
publication
of
phillips
'
paper
,
the
idea
that
there
was
a
trade-off
between
a
strong
economy
and
low
inflation
caught
the
imagination
of
academic
economists
and
policy-makers
alike.
paul
samuelson
and
robert
solow
wrote
an
influential
article
describing
the
possibilities
suggested
by
the
phillips
curve
in
the
context
of
the
united
states.
what
people
think
of
as
the
phillips
curve
has
changed
substantially
over
time
,
but
remains
an
important
feature
of
macroeconomic
analysis
of
economic
fluctuations.
had
he
lived
longer
,
phillips
'
contributions
might
have
been
worthy
of
a
nobel
prize
in
economics.
he
made
several
other
notable
contributions
to
economics
,
particularly
relating
to
stabilization
policy.
he
returned
to
australia
in
<year>
for
a
position
at
australian
national
university
which
allowed
him
to
devote
half
his
time
to
chinese
studies.
in
<year>
the
effects
of
his
war
deprivations
and
smoking
caught
up
with
him.
he
had
a
stroke
,
prompting
an
early
retirement
and
return
to
auckland
,
new
zealand
,
where
he
taught
at
the
university
of
auckland.
he

in

with

later
as
a

lab
assistant
by

in

received
her
ph.d.
degree

under
alfred
tarski
with
a
dissertation
on
``
definability
and
decision
problems
in
arithmetic
''
.
:
<integer>
her
dissertation
showed
that
the
theory
of
the
rational
numbers
was
an
undecidable
problem
,
by
demonstrating
that
elementary
number
theory
could
be
defined
in

of
the
rationals.
(
elementary
number
theory
was
already
known
to
be
undecidable
by
gödel
's
first
incompleteness
theorem.
)
here
is
an
excerpt
from
her
thesis
:
''
this
consequence
of
our
discussion
is
interesting
because
of
a
result
of
gödel
which
shows
that
the
variety
of
relations
between
integers
(
and
operations
on
integers
)
which
are
arithmetically
definable
in
terms
of
addition
and
multiplication
of
integers
is
very
great.
for
instance
from
theorem
<decimal>
and
gödel
's
result
,
we
can
conclude
that
the
relation
which
holds
between
three
rationals
a
,
b
,
and
n
if
and
only
if
n
is
a
positive
integer
and
a=bn
is
definable
in
the
arithmetic

hilbert
's
tenth
problem
===
hilbert
's
tenth
problem
asks
for
an
algorithm
to
determine
whether
a
diophantine
equation
has
any
solutions
in
integers.
robinson
began
exploring
methods
for
this
problem
in
<year>
while
at
the
rand
corporation.
her
work
regarding
diophantine
representation
for
exponentiation
and
her
method
of
using
pell
's
equation
led
to
the
j.r.
hypothesis
(
named
after
robinson
)
in
<year>.
proving
this
hypothesis
would
be
central
in
the
final
solution.
her
research
publications
would
lead
to
collaborations
with
martin
davis
,
hilary
putnam
,
and
yuri
matiyasevich.in
<year>
,
robinson
first
met
martin
davis
,
then
an
instructor
at
the
university
of
illinois
at
urbana-champaign
,
who
was
trying
to
show
that
all
sets
with
listability
property
were
diophantine
in
contrast
to
robinson
's
attempt
to
show
that
a
few
special
sets
—
including
prime
numbers
and
the
powers
of
<integer>
—
were
diophantine.
robinson
and
davis
started
collaborating
in
<year>
and
were
later
joined
by
hilary
putnam
,
they
then
showed
that
the
solutions
to
a
“goldilocks”
equation
was
key
to
hilbert
's
tenth
problem.in
<year>
,
the
problem
was
resolved
in
the
negative
;
that
is
,
they
showed
that
no
such
algorithm
can
exist.
through
the
<year>s
,
robinson
continued
working
with
matiyasevich
on
one
of
their
solution
's
corollaries
,
which
she
once
stated
that
there
is
a
constant
n
such
that
,
given
a
diophantine
equation
with
any
number
of
parameters
and
in
any
number
of
unknowns
,
one
can
effectively
transform
this
equation
into
another
with
the
same
parameters
but
in
only
n
unknowns
such
that
both
equations
are
solvable
or
unsolvable
for
the
same
values
of
the
parameters.
at
the
time
the
solution
was
first
published
,
the
authors
established
n
=
<integer>.
robinson
and
matiyasevich
's
joint
work
would
produce
further
reduction
to
<integer>
unknowns.

===
during
the

,
robinson
spent
a

or
so
at
the

monica
researching
game
theory.
her
<year>
technical
report
,
``

''
is
the
first

i
was
nominated

i
found

==
work
with
pigeons
==
william
keeton
had
always
had
a
fascination
with
pigeon
homing
techniques
from
the
time
he
was
a
child.
when
he
was
nine
years
old
he
received
his
first
homing
pigeons
which
he
raced
and
trained
with
his
friends.
many
scientists
held
speculative
ideas
about
the
techniques
that
pigeons
might
be
using
,
including
the
use
of
the
position
of
the
sun
,
the
earth
's
magnetic
field
,
landmark
recognition
and
olfactory
navigation.
william
keeton
tested
these
various
speculations
throughout
his
time
at
cornell
university.
===
magnetic
interference
===
in
william
keeton
's
<year>
magnets
interfere
with
pigeon
homing
paper
,
william
keeton
proved
that
pigeons
were
affected
by
changes
in
the
magnetic
field
surrounding
them
,
and
that
pigeons
were
using
the
earth
's
magnetic
field
as
one
way
of
finding
their
way
home.
in
this
experiment
,
william
keeton
attached
magnets
to
the
back
of
pigeons
just
before
they
were
released
and
measured
their
vanishing
point
(
in
what
direction
they
had
flown
out
of
sight
)
and
the
time
it
took
to
find
their
way
home
for
both
the
experimental
birds
and
with
the
control
birds
(
control
birds
had
a
piece
of
brass
glued
to
their
back
of
the
same
weight
as
the
magnet
)
.
keeton
's
results
showed
that
when
the
sun
was
visible
,
the
magnets
would
not
usually
prevent
the
birds
from
finding
their
way
home
,
but
when
the
sky
was
overcast
the
birds
with
magnets
on
their
back
were
much
more
unsuccessful
and
slower
at
finding
their
way
back
home
than
the
control
birds.
previous
scientists
had
shown
that
pigeons
were
not
relying
entirely
on
the
sun
to
navigate
home
as
many
scientists
had
speculated
,
when
they
found
that
many
pigeons
were
able
to
navigate
successfully
under
completely
overcast
skies.
this
notion
led
keeton
to
question
whether
the
pigeons
were
using
the
earth
's
magnetic
field
to
orient
themselves
and
navigate
home
successfully.
keeton
's
experiments
with
magnets
showed
that
there
was
a
combination
of
processes
being
used
by
the
pigeons
to
navigate
home
,
but
the
use
of
the
earth
's
magnetic
field
was
very
important
for
pigeon
orientation
and
navigation.
under
clear
skies
with
the
sun
visible
,
both
the
birds
with
magnets
and
the
birds
without
magnets
had
little
trouble
navigating
back
to
the
loft
,
yet
at
unfamiliar
locations
with
overcast
skies
the
birds
with
magnets
glued
to
their
backs
were
unable
to
successfully
orient
themselves
and
navigate
back
to
the
loft.
keeton
speculated
that
this
was
occurring
because
the
birds
without
magnets
were
able
to
use
the
earth
's
magnetic
fields
to
orient
themselves
in
the
correct
direction
,
whereas
the
birds
with
magnets
attached
to
their
backs
were
unable
to
use
the
sun
,
familiar
landmarks
,
or
the
earth
's
magnetic
fields
to
find
their
way
home.
this
discovery
was
extremely
useful
in
explaining
one
of
the
most
interesting
questions
of
bird
navigation.
===
olfactory
interference
===
many
scientists
hypothesized
that
pigeons
were
using
olfactory
information
as
part
of
the
process
in
finding
their
way
back
to
the
loft.
in
italy
,
a
study
by
n.e.
baldaccini
,
in
which
the
bills
of
pigeons
were
applied
with
a
strong
odor
,
showed
results
that
the
pigeons
had
less
accurate
initial
orientation.
baldaccini
also
performed
an
experiment
in
which
he
reared
pigeons
in
a
loft
in
which
the
wind
was
deflected
by
<integer>
degrees.
baldaccini
's
results
showed
that
a
deflection
in
the
wind
while
the
pigeons
were
young
proved
to
have
an
effect
on
their
initial
orientation
after
being
released.
keeton
replicated
this
experiment
but
found
that
there
was
a
smaller
deflection
than
the
results
in
baldaccini
's
experiment
in
italy.
keeton
speculated
that
there
may
be
an
effect
on
initial
orientation
based
on
an
olfactory
map
,
but
the
experiment
was
too
general
for
proving
that
this
was
indeed
what
was
occurring
in
this
experiment.

john
lancaster
(
<day>
–
<day>
)
was
an
australian
mathematical
economist
and
john
bates
clark
professor
of
economics
at
columbia
university.
he
is
best
known
for
the
development
of
the
theory
of
the
second
best
with
richard
lipsey.
lancaster
was
also
active
in
developing
the
calculus
of
qualitative
economics
,
formulating
the
household
production
function
,
and
applying
the
hedonic
model
to
the
estimation
of
housing
prices.
in
a
<year>
paper
,
lancaster
developed
what
he
called
a
``
new
theory
of
consumer
demand
''
,
in
which
the
then
standard
microeconomic
demand
theory
was
modified
by
stipulating
that
what
consumers
are
seeking
to
acquire
is
not
goods
themselves
(
e.g.
cars
or
train
journeys
)
but
the
characteristics
they
contain
(
e.g.
transport
from
a
to
b
,
display
of
fashion
sense
)
.
as
palda
(
<year>
)
explains
the
second
evolution
in
spatial
economics
was
due
to
kelvin
lancaster.
his
insight
was
that
the
basic
qualities
that
consumers
seek
could
be
manipulated
by
combining
different
products.
hotelling
had
not
considered
this
possibility.
he
had
been
content
to
accept
that
one
good
provided
one
underlying
feature
that
could
be
measured
in
characteristics
space.
lancaster
saw
the
matter
in
greater
breadth.
dinner
was
not
just
food
on
a
table.
it
was
an
attempt
to
manipulate
the
basic
constituents
of
flavor
and
nutrition
into
a
satisfying
gastronomic
experience.
being
a
good
cook
meant
knowing
that
taste
had
several
dimensions
including
sweet
,
salty
,
sour
,
and
savory.
for
a
meal
to
be
agreeable
,
it
had
to
combine
these
elements
of
flavor
and
it
also
had
to
be
easily
digested
,
suggesting
that
nutritional
dimensions
such
as
greasiness
,
protein
content
,
and
temperature
had
to
figure
into
the
cook’s
understanding.
these
basic
culinary
entities
could
each
be
thought
of
as
lying
on
a
left-right
scale
,
or
space.
the
ideal
meal
,
then
,
sought
to
combine
these
features
by
varying
each
one
as
precisely
as
possible.
this
theory
provides
a
convenient
account
of
the
difference
between
less
developed
(
so
called
``
primitive
''
)
consumption
economies
,
in
which
there
are
fewer
goods
than
characteristics
,
and
more
developed
(
``
sophisticated
''
)
consumption
economies
,
in
which
there
are
more
goods
than
characteristics
,
so
that
consumers
can
secure
any
combination
of
characteristics
they
desire
,
subject
only
to
budget
constraints.
it
also
provides
a
way
of
predicting
demand
for
new
commodities
,
so
long
as
they
do
not
embody
any
new
characteristics.according
to
economist
jagdish
bhagwati
,
``
he
was
widely
regarded
as
a
potential
recipient
of
the
nobel
prize
,
for
the
notable
impact
that
had
been
made
by
his
contributions
to
the
theory
of
second
best
and
the
integration
of
variety
into
economic
theory.
he
joins
the
list
of
extraordinary
economists
such
as
joan
robinson
,
roy
harrod
,
and
mancur
olson
whom
death
deprived
of

early
life
and
education
==
sagan
was
born
in
the
bensonhurst
neighborhood
of
brooklyn
,
new
york
on
november
<integer>
,
<year>.
his
father
,
samuel
sagan
,
was
an
immigrant
garment
worker
from
kamianets-podilskyi
,
then
in
the
russian
empire
,
in
today
's
ukraine.
his
mother
,
rachel
molly
gruber
,
was
a
housewife
from
new
york.
carl
was
named
in
honor
of
rachel
's
biological
mother
,
chaiya
clara
,
in
sagan
's
words
,
``
the
mother
she
never
knew
''
,
because
she
died
while
giving
birth
to
her
second
child.
rachel
's
father
remarried
to
a
woman
named
rose.
according
to
carol
(
carl
's
sister
)
,
rachel
``
never
accepted
rose
as
her
mother.
she
knew
she
was
n't
her
birth
mother
...
she
was
a
rather
rebellious
child
and
young
adult
...
'emancipated
woman
'
,
we
'd
call
her
now.
''
the
family
lived
in
a
modest
apartment
near
the
atlantic
ocean
,
in
bensonhurst
,
a
brooklyn
neighborhood.
according
to
sagan
,
they
were
reform
jews
,
the
most
liberal
of
north
american
judaism
's
four
main
groups.
carl
and
his
sister
agreed
that
their
father
was
not
especially
religious
,
but
that
their
mother
``
definitely
believed
in
god
,
and
was
active
in
the
temple
;
...
and
served
only
kosher
meat
''
.
:
<integer>
during
the
depths
of
the
depression
,
his
father
worked
as
a
theater
usher.
:
<integer>
according
to
biographer
keay
davidson
,
sagan
's
``
inner
war
''
was
a
result
of
his
close
relationship
with
both
of
his
parents
,
who
were
in
many
ways
``
opposites
''
.
sagan
traced
his
later
analytical
urges
to
his
mother
,
a
woman
who
had
been
extremely
poor
as
a
child
in
new
york
city
during
world
war
i
and
the
<year>s.
:
<integer>
as
a
young
woman
,
she
had
held
her
own
intellectual
ambitions
,
but
they
were
frustrated
by
social
restrictions
:
her
poverty
,
her
status
as
a
woman
and
a
wife
,
and
her
jewish
ethnicity.
davidson
notes
that
she
therefore
``
worshipped
her
only
son
,
carl.
he
would
fulfill
her
unfulfilled
dreams.
''
:
<integer>
however
,
he
claimed
that
his
sense
of
wonder
came
from
his
father
,
who
in
his
free
time
gave
apples
to
the
poor
or
helped
soothe
labor-management
tensions
within
new
york
's
garment
industry.
:
<integer>
although
he
was
awed
by
carl
's
intellectual
abilities
,
he
took
his
son
's
inquisitiveness
in
stride
and
saw
it
as
part
of
his
growing
up.
:
<integer>
in
his
later
years
as
a
writer
and
scientist
,
sagan
would
often
draw
on
his
childhood
memories
to
illustrate
scientific
points
,
as
he
did
in
his
book
shadows
of
forgotten
ancestors.
:
<integer>
sagan
describes
his
parents
'
influence
on
his
later
thinking
:
my
parents
were
not
scientists.
they
knew
almost
nothing
about
science.
but
in
introducing
me
simultaneously
to
skepticism
and
to
wonder
,
they
taught
me
the
two
uneasily
cohabiting
modes
of
thought
that
are
central
to
the
scientific
method.
sagan
recalls
that
one
of
his
most
defining
moments
was
when
his
parents
took
him
to
the
<year>
new
york
world
's
fair
when
he
was
four
years
old.
the
exhibits
became
a
turning
point
in
his
life.
he
later
recalled
the
moving
map
of
the
america
of
tomorrow
exhibit
:
``
it
showed
beautiful
highways
and
cloverleaves
and
little
general
motors
cars
all
carrying
people
to
skyscrapers
,
buildings
with
lovely
spires
,
flying
buttresses—and
it
looked
great
!
''
:
<integer>
at
other
exhibits
,
he
remembered
how
a
flashlight
that
shone
on
a
photoelectric
cell
created
a
crackling
sound
,
and
how
the
sound
from
a
tuning
fork
became
a
wave
on
an
oscilloscope.
he
also
witnessed
the
future
media
technology
that
would
replace
radio
:
television.
sagan
wrote
:
:
<integer>
plainly
,
the
world
held
wonders
of
a
kind
i
had
never
guessed.
how
could
a
tone
become
a
picture
and
light
become
a
noise
?
he
also
saw
one
of
the
fair
's
most
publicized
events
,
the
burial
of
a
time
capsule
at
flushing
meadows
,
which
contained
mementos
of
the
<year>s
to
be
recovered
by
earth
's
descendants
in
a
future
millennium.
``
the
time
capsule
thrilled
carl
''
,
writes
davidson.
as
an
adult
,
sagan
and
his
colleagues
would
create
similar
time
capsules—capsules
that
would
be
sent
out
into
the
galaxy
;
these
were
the
pioneer
plaque
and
the
voyager
golden
record
précis
,
all
of
which
were
spinoffs
of
sagan
's
memories
of
the
world
's
fair.
:
<integer>
during
world
war
ii
sagan
's
family
worried
about
the
fate
of
their
european
relatives.
sagan
,
however
,
was
generally
unaware
of
the
details
of
the
ongoing
war.
he
wrote
,
``
sure
,
we
had
relatives
who
were
caught
up
in
the
holocaust.
hitler
was
not
a
popular
fellow
in
our
household
...
but
on
the
other
hand
,
i
was
fairly
insulated
from
the
horrors
of
the
war.
''
his
sister
,
carol
,
said
that
their
mother
``
above
all
wanted
to
protect
carl
...
she
had
an
extraordinarily
difficult
time
dealing
with
world
war
ii
and
the
holocaust.
''
:
<integer>
sagan
's
book
the
demon-haunted
world
(
<year>
)
included
his
memories
of
this
conflicted
period
,
when
his
family
dealt
with
the
realities
of
the
war
in
europe
but
tried
to
prevent
it
from
undermining
his
optimistic
spirit.
===
inquisitiveness
about
nature
===
soon
after
entering
elementary
school
he
began
to
express
a
strong
inquisitiveness
about
nature.
sagan
recalled
taking
his
first
trips
to
the
public
library
alone
,
at
the
age
of
five
,
when
his
mother
got
him
a
library
card.
he
wanted
to
learn
what
stars
were
,
since
none
of
his
friends
or
their
parents
could
give
him
a
clear
answer
:
:
<integer>
i
went
to
the
librarian
and
asked
for
a
book
about
stars
;
...
and
the
answer
was
stunning.
it
was
that
the
sun
was
a
star
but
really
close.
the
stars
were
suns
,
but
so
far
away
they
were
just
little
points
of
light
...
the
scale
of
the
universe
suddenly
opened
up
to
me.
it
was
a
kind
of
religious
experience.
there
was
a
magnificence
to
it
,
a
grandeur
,
a
scale
which
has
never
left
me.
never
ever
left
me.
at
about
age
six
or
seven
,
he
and
a
close
friend
took
trips
to
the
american
museum
of
natural
history
across
the
east
river
in
manhattan.
while
there
,
they
went
to
the
hayden
planetarium
and
walked
around
the
museum
's
exhibits
of
space
objects
,
such
as
meteorites
,
and
displays
of
dinosaurs
and
animals
in
natural
settings.
sagan
writes
about
those
visits
:
:
<integer>
i
was
transfixed
by
the
dioramas—lifelike
representations
of
animals
and
their
habitats

over

on

hind
legs
,

or

tall
,
and
staring
me
right
in
the
eye.
his
parents
helped
nurture
his
growing
interest
in
science
by
buying
him
chemistry
sets
and
reading
materials.
his
interest
in
space
,
however
,
was
his
primary
focus
,
especially
after
reading
science
fiction
stories
by
writers
such
as
h.
g.
wells
and
edgar
rice
burroughs
,
which
stirred
his
imagination
about
life
on
other
planets
such
as
mars.
according
to
biographer
ray
spangenburg
,
these
early
years
as
sagan
tried
to
understand
the
mysteries
of
the
planets
became
a
``
driving
force
in
his
life
,
a
continual
spark
to
his
intellect
,
and
a
quest
that
would
never
be
forgotten
''
.in
<year>
he
discovered
astounding
science
fiction
magazine
,
which
introduced
him
to
more
hard
science
fiction
speculations
than
those
in
burroughs
's
novels.
that
same
year
inaugurated
the
``
flying
saucer
''
mass
hysteria
with
the
young
carl
suspecting
that
the
``
discs
''
might
be
alien
spaceships.

was
bored

unchallenging
classes
and
uninspiring
teachers.
:
<integer>
his
teachers
realized
this
and
tried
to
convince
his

to
send
him
to

telling
them

his

could
not
afford
it.
sagan
was
made
president
of
the
school
's
chemistry
club
,
and
at
home
he
set
up
his
own
laboratory.
he
taught
himself
about
molecules
by
making
cardboard
cutouts
to
help
him
visualize
how
molecules
were
formed
:
``
i
found
that

he
said.
:
<integer>
sagan
remained
mostly
interested
in
astronomy
as
a
hobby
and
in
his
junior
year
made
it
a
career
goal
after
he
learned
that
astronomers
were
paid
for
doing
what
he
always
enjoyed
:
``
that
was

could
do
astronomy
full-time

not
just
part-time.
''
:
<integer>
before
the
end
of
high
school
,
he
entered
an
essay
contest
in
which
he
posed
the
question
of
whether
human
contact
with
advanced
life
forms
from
another
planet
might
be
as
disastrous
for
people
on
earth
as
it
was
for
native
americans
when
they
first
had
contact
with
europeans.
the
subject
was
considered
controversial
,
but
his
rhetorical
skill
won
over
the
judges
,
and
they
awarded
him
first
prize.
by
graduation
,
his
classmates
had
voted
him
``
most
likely

and
put
him
in

to
be
valedictorian.

on
the
atmosphere
of

,
while
also
working
with
nasa
's

and
served
as
a
``

''
to
the

the
publication
of
sagan
's
science
article
,
in
<year>
harvard
university
astronomers
fred
whipple
and
donald
menzel
offered
sagan
the
opportunity
to
give
a
colloquium
at
harvard
and
subsequently
offered
him
a
lecturer
position
at
the
institution.
sagan
instead
asked
to
be
made
an
assistant
professor
,
and
eventually
whipple
and
menzel
were
able
to
convince
harvard
to
offer
sagan
the
assistant

position
he
requested.
sagan
lectured
,
performed
research
,
and
advised
graduate

<year>
,
as
well
as
working
at
the
smithsonian
astrophysical
observatory
,
also
located
in
cambridge
,
massachusetts.
in
<year>
,
sagan
was
denied
tenure
at
harvard.
he
later
indicated
that
the
decision
was
very
much
unexpected.
the
tenure
denial
has
been
blamed
on
several
factors
,
including
that
he
focused
his
interests
too
broadly
across
a
number
of
areas
(
while
the
norm
in
academia
is
to
become
a
renowned
expert
in
a
narrow
specialty
)
,
and
perhaps
because
of
his
well-publicized
scientific
advocacy
,
which
some
scientists
perceived
as
borrowing
the
ideas
of
others
for
little
more
than
self-promotion.
an
advisor
from
his
years
as
an
undergraduate
student
,
harold
urey
,
wrote
a
letter
to
the
tenure
committee
recommending
strongly
against
tenure
for
sagan.
long
before
the
ill-fated
tenure
process
,
cornell
university
astronomer
thomas
gold
had
courted
sagan
to
move
to
ithaca
,
new
york
,
and
join
the
faculty
at
cornell.
following
the
denial
of
tenure
from
harvard
,
sagan
accepted
gold
's
offer
and
remained
a
faculty
member
at
cornell
for
nearly
<integer>
years
until
his
death
in
<year>.
unlike
harvard
,
the
smaller
and
more
laid-back
astronomy
department
at
cornell
welcomed
sagan
's
growing
celebrity
status.
following
two
years
as
an
associate
professor
,
sagan
became
a
full
professor
at
cornell
in
<year>
and
directed
the
laboratory
for
planetary
studies
there.
from
<year>
to
<year>
,
he
was
associate
director
of
the
center
for
radiophysics
and
space
research
(
crsr
)
at
cornell.
in
<year>
,
he
became
the
david
duncan
professor
of
astronomy
and
space
sciences
,
a
position
he
held
for
the
remainder
of
his
life.sagan
was
associated
with
the
u.s.
space
program
from
its
inception.
from
the
<year>s
onward
,
he
worked
as
an
advisor
to
nasa
,
where
one
of
his
duties
included
briefing
the
apollo
astronauts
before
their
flights
to
the
moon.
sagan
contributed
to
many
of
the
robotic
spacecraft
missions
that
explored
the
solar
system
,
arranging
experiments
on
many
of
the
expeditions.
sagan
assembled
the
first
physical
message
that
was
sent
into
space
:
a
gold-plated
plaque
,
attached
to
the
space
probe
pioneer
<integer>
,
launched
in
<year>.
pioneer
<integer>
,
also
carrying
another
copy
of
the
plaque
,
was
launched
the
following
year.
he
continued
to
refine
his
designs
;
the
most
elaborate
message
he
helped
to
develop
and
assemble
was
the
voyager
golden
record
,
which
was
sent
out
with
the
voyager
space
probes
in
<year>.
sagan
often
challenged
the
decisions
to
fund
the
space
shuttle
and
the
international
space
station
at
the
expense
of
further
robotic
missions.
===
scientific
achievements
===
former
student
david
morrison
described
sagan
as
``
an
'idea
person
'
and
a
master
of
intuitive
physical
arguments
and
'back
of
the
envelope
'
calculations
''
,
and
gerard
kuiper
said
that
``
some
persons
work
best
in
specializing
on
a
major
program
in
the
laboratory
;
others
are
best
in
liaison
between
sciences.
dr.
sagan
belongs
in
the
latter
group.
''
sagan
's
contributions
were
central
to
the
discovery
of
the
high
surface
temperatures
of
the
planet
venus.
in
the
early
<year>s
no
one
knew
for
certain
the
basic
conditions
of
venus
'
surface
,
and
sagan
listed
the
possibilities
in
a
report
later
depicted
for
popularization
in
a
time
life
book
planets.
his
own
view
was
that
venus
was
dry
and
very
hot
as
opposed
to
the
balmy
paradise
others
had
imagined.
he
had
investigated
radio
waves
from
venus
and
concluded
that
there
was
a
surface
temperature
of
<integer>
°c
(
<integer>
°f
)
.
as
a
visiting
scientist
to
nasa
's
jet
propulsion
laboratory
,
he
contributed
to
the
first
mariner
missions
to
venus
,
working
on
the
design
and
management
of
the
project.
mariner
<integer>
confirmed
his
conclusions
on
the
surface
conditions
of
venus
in
<year>.
sagan
was
among
the
first
to
hypothesize
that
saturn
's
moon
titan
might
possess
oceans
of
liquid
compounds
on
its
surface
and
that
jupiter
's
moon
europa
might
possess
subsurface
oceans
of
water.
this
would
make
europa
potentially
habitable.
europa
's
subsurface
ocean
of
water
was
later
indirectly
confirmed
by
the
spacecraft
galileo.
the
mystery
of
titan
's
reddish
haze
was
also
solved
with
sagan
's
help.
the
reddish
haze
was
revealed
to
be
due
to
complex
organic
molecules
constantly
raining
down
onto
titan
's
surface.sagan
further
contributed
insights
regarding
the
atmospheres
of
venus
and
jupiter
,
as
well
as
seasonal
changes
on
mars.
he
also
perceived
global
warming
as
a
growing
,
man-made
danger
and
likened
it
to
the
natural
development
of
venus
into
a
hot
,
life-hostile
planet
through
a
kind
of
runaway
greenhouse
effect.
sagan
and
his
cornell
colleague
edwin
ernest
salpeter
speculated
about
life
in
jupiter
's
clouds
,
given
the
planet
's
dense
atmospheric
composition
rich
in
organic
molecules.
he
studied
the
observed
color
variations
on
mars
'
surface
and
concluded
that
they
were
not
seasonal
or
vegetational
changes
as
most
believed
,
but
shifts
in
surface
dust
caused
by
windstorms.
sagan
is
also
known
for
his
research
on
the
possibilities
of
extraterrestrial
life
,
including
experimental
demonstration
of
the
production
of
amino
acids
from

.
he
was
denied

===
sagan
's
number
is
the
number

scientific

sagan
's
ability
to
convey
his
ideas
allowed
many
people
to
understand
the
cosmos
better—simultaneously
emphasizing
the
value
and
worthiness
of
the
human
race
,
and
the
relative
insignificance
of
the
earth
in
comparison
to
the
universe.
he
delivered
the
<year>
series
of
royal
institution
christmas
lectures
in
london.sagan
was
a
proponent
of
the
search
for

life.
he
urged
the
scientific
community
to
listen
with
radio
telescopes
for
signals
from
potential
intelligent
extraterrestrial
life-forms.
sagan
was
so
persuasive
that
by

he
was
able
to
get
a
petition
advocating
seti
published
in
the
journal
science
,
signed
by
<integer>

,
including
seven
nobel
prize
winners.
this
signaled
a
tremendous
increase
in
the
respectability
of

field.
sagan
also
helped
frank

sagan
was
chief

he
co-founded
the
planetary

.
at
the
height
of
the
cold
war
,
sagan
became
involved
in
nuclear
disarmament
efforts
by
promoting
hypotheses
on
the
effects
of
nuclear
war
,
when
paul
crutzen
's
``
twilight

''
concept
suggested
that
a
substantial
nuclear
exchange
could
trigger
a
nuclear
twilight
and
upset
the
delicate
balance
of
life
on
earth
by
cooling
the

in

he
was
one
of
five
authors—the
``

—in
the
follow-up
``
ttaps
''
model
(
as
the
research
article
came
to
be
known
)
,
which
contained
the
first
use
of
the
term
``
nuclear
winter
''
,
which
his
colleague
richard
p.
turco
had
coined.
in

he
co-authored

the

and
the
end
of

,
which
explains
the
nuclear-winter
hypothesis
and
advocates
nuclear

sagan
received
a
great
deal
of
skepticism
and
disdain
for
the
use
of
media
to
disseminate
a
very
uncertain
hypothesis.
a
personal
correspondence
with
nuclear
physicist
edward
teller
around
<year>
began
amicably
,
with
teller
expressing
support
for
continued
research
to
ascertain
the
credibility
of
the
winter
hypothesis.
however
,
sagan
and
teller
's
correspondence
would
ultimately
result
in
teller
writing
:
``
a
propagandist
is
one
who
uses

i
can
compliment

.
biographers
of
sagan
would
also
comment
that
from

,
nuclear

was
a

point
for
sagan
,

wells
on

in
response
to
any
physical
challenge
to
iraqi
control
of
the

,
sagan
together
with
his
``
ttaps
''
colleagues
and
paul
crutzen
,
warned
in
january
<year>
in
the
baltimore
sun
and
wilmington
morning
star
newspapers
that
if
the
fires
were
left
to
burn
over
a
period
of
several
months
,
enough
smoke
from
the
<integer>
or
so
<year>
kuwaiti
oil
fires
``
might
get
so
high
as
to
disrupt
agriculture
in
much
of
south
asia
...
''
and
that
this
possibility
should
``
affect
the
war
plans
''
;
these
claims
were
also
the
subject
of
a
televised
debate
between
sagan
and
physicist
fred
singer
on
january
<integer>
,
aired
on
the
abc
news
program
nightline.
in
the
televised
debate
,
sagan
argued
that
the
effects
of
the
smoke
would
be
similar
to
the
effects
of
a
nuclear
winter
,
with
singer
arguing
to
the
contrary.
after
the
debate
,
the
fires
burnt
for
many
months
before
extinguishing
efforts
were
complete.
the
results
of
the
smoke
did
not
produce
continental-sized
cooling.
sagan
later
conceded
in
the
demon-haunted
world
that
the
prediction
did
not
turn
out
to
be
correct
:
``
it
was
pitch
black
at
noon
and
temperatures
dropped
<integer>–<integer>
°c
over
the
persian
gulf
,
but
not
much
smoke
reached
stratospheric
altitudes
and
asia
was
spared
''
.in
his
later
years
sagan
advocated
the
creation
of
an
organized
search
for
asteroids/near-earth
objects
(
neos
)
that
might
impact
the
earth
but
to
forestall
or
postpone
developing
the
technological
methods
that
would
be
needed
to
defend
against
them.
he
argued
that
all
of
the
numerous
methods
proposed
to
alter
the
orbit
of
an
asteroid
,
including
the
employment
of
nuclear
detonations
,
created
a
deflection
dilemma
:
if
the
ability
to
deflect
an
asteroid
away
from
the
earth
exists
,
then
one
would
also
have
the
ability
to
divert
a
non-threatening
object
towards
earth
,
creating
an
immensely
destructive
weapon.
in
a
<year>
paper
he
co-authored
,
he
ridiculed
a
<integer>-day
long
``
near-earth
object
interception
workshop
''
held
by
los
alamos
national
laboratory
(
lanl
)
in
<year>
that
did
not
,
``
even
in
passing
''
state
that
such
interception
and
deflection
technologies
could
have
these
``
ancillary
dangers
''
.sagan
remained
hopeful
that
the
natural
neo
impact
threat
and
the
intrinsically
double-edged
essence
of
the
methods
to
prevent
these
threats
would
serve
as
a
``
new
and
potent
motivation
to
maturing
international
relations
''
.
later
acknowledging
that
,
with
sufficient
international
oversight
,
in
the
future
a
``
work
our
way
up
''
approach
to
implementing
nuclear
explosive
deflection
methods
could
be
fielded
,
and
when
sufficient
knowledge
was
gained
,
to
use
them
to
aid
in
mining
asteroids.
his
interest
in
the
use
of
nuclear
detonations
in
space
grew
out
of
his
work
in
<year>
for
the
armour
research
foundation
's
project
a119
,
concerning
the
possibility
of
detonating
a
nuclear
device
on
the
lunar
surface.sagan
was
a
critic
of
plato
,
having
said
of
the
ancient
greek
philosopher
:
``
science
and
mathematics
were
to
be
removed
from
the
hands
of
the
merchants
and
the
artisans.
this
tendency
found
its
most
effective
advocate
in
a
follower
of
pythagoras
named
plato
''
and
he
(
plato
)
believed
that
ideas
were
far
more
real
than
the
natural
world.
he
advised
the
astronomers
not
to
waste
their
time
observing
the
stars
and
planets.
it
was
better
,
he
believed
,
just
to
think
about
them.
plato
expressed
hostility
to
observation
and
experiment.
he
taught
contempt
for
the
real
world
and
disdain
for
the
practical
application
of
scientific
knowledge.
plato
's
followers
succeeded
in
extinguishing
the
light
of
science
and
experiment
that
had
been
kindled
by
democritus
and
the
other
ionians.
in
<year>
(
as
part
of
his
book
the
demon-haunted
world
)
sagan
popularized
a
set
of
tools
for
skeptical
thinking
called
the
``
baloney
detection
kit
''
,
a
phrase
first
coined
by
arthur
felberbaum
,
a
friend
of
his
wife
ann
druyan.
===
popularizing
science
===
speaking
about
his
activities
in
popularizing
science
,
sagan
said
that
there
were
at
least
two
reasons
for
scientists
to
share
the
purposes
of
science
and
its
contemporary
state.
simple
self-interest
was
one
:
much
of
the
funding
for
science
came
from
the
public
,
and
the
public
therefore
had
the
right
to
know
how
the
money
was
being
spent.
if
scientists
increased
public
admiration
for
science
,
there
was
a
good
chance
of
having
more
public
supporters.
the
other
reason
was
the
excitement
of
communicating
one
's
own
excitement
about
science
to
others.following
the
success
of
cosmos
,
sagan
set
up
his
own
publishing
firm
,
cosmos
store
,
in
order
to
publish
science
books
for
the
general
public.
it
was
not
successful.
===
criticisms
===
while
sagan
was
widely
adored
by
the
general
public
,
his
reputation
in
the
scientific
community
was
more
polarized.
critics
sometimes
characterized
his
work
as
fanciful
,
non-rigorous
,
and
self-aggrandizing
,
and
others
complained
in
his
later
years
that
he
neglected
his
role
as
a
faculty
member
to
foster
his
celebrity
status.one
of
sagan
's
harshest
critics
,
harold
urey
,
felt
that
sagan
was
getting
too
much
publicity
for
a
scientist
and
was
treating
some
scientific
theories
too
casually.
urey
and
sagan
were
said
to
have
different
philosophies
of
science
,
according
to
davidson.
while
urey
was
an
``
old-time
empiricist
''
who
avoided
theorizing
about
the
unknown
,
sagan
was
by
contrast
willing
to
speculate
openly
about
such
matters.
fred
whipple
wanted
harvard
to
keep
sagan
there
,
but
learned
that
because
urey
was
a
nobel
laureate
,
his
opinion
was
an
important
factor
in
harvard
denying
sagan
tenure.sagan
's
harvard
friend
lester
grinspoon
also
stated
:
``
i
know
harvard
well
enough
to
know
there
are
people
there
who
certainly
do
not
like
people
who
are
outspoken.
''
grinspoon
added
:
wherever
you
turned
,
there
was
one
astronomer
being
quoted
on
everything
,
one
astronomer
whose
face
you
were
seeing
on
tv
,
and
one
astronomer
whose
books
had
the
preferred
display
slot
at
the
local
bookstore.
some
,
like
urey
,
later
came
to
realize
that
sagan
's
popular
brand
of
scientific
advocacy
was
beneficial
to
the
science
as
a
whole.
urey
especially
liked
sagan
's
<year>
book
the
dragons
of
eden
and
wrote
sagan
with
his
opinion
:
``
i
like
it
very
much
and
am
amazed
that
someone
like
you
has
such
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
various
features
of
the
problem
...
i
congratulate
you
...
you
are
a
man
of
many
talents.
''
sagan
was
accused
of
borrowing
some
ideas
of
others
for
his
own
benefit
and
countered
these
claims
by
explaining
that
the
misappropriation
was
an
unfortunate
side
effect
of
his
role
as
a
science
communicator
and
explainer
,
and
that
he
attempted
to
give
proper
credit
whenever
possible.
===
social
concerns
===
sagan
believed
that
the
drake
equation
,
on
substitution
of
reasonable
estimates
,
suggested
that
a
large
number
of
extraterrestrial
civilizations
would
form
,
but
that
the
lack
of
evidence
of
such
civilizations
highlighted
by
the
fermi
paradox
suggests
technological
civilizations
tend
to
self-destruct.
this
stimulated
his
interest
in
identifying
and
publicizing
ways
that
humanity
could
destroy
itself
,
with
the
hope
of
avoiding
such
a
cataclysm
and
eventually
becoming
a
spacefaring
species.
sagan
's
deep
concern
regarding
the
potential
destruction
of
human
civilization
in
a
nuclear
holocaust
was
conveyed
in
a
memorable
cinematic
sequence
in
the
final
episode
of
cosmos
,
called
``
who
speaks
for
earth
?
''
sagan
had
already
resigned
from
the
air
force
scientific
advisory
board
's
ufo
investigating
condon
committee
and
voluntarily
surrendered
his
top-secret
clearance
in
protest
over
the
vietnam
war.
following
his
marriage
to
his
third
wife
(
novelist
ann
druyan
)
in
june
<year>
,
sagan
became
more
politically
active—particularly
in
opposing
escalation
of
the
nuclear
arms
race
under
president
ronald
reagan.
in
march
<year>
,
reagan
announced
the
strategic
defense
initiative—a
multibillion-dollar
project
to
develop
a
comprehensive
defense
against
attack
by
nuclear
missiles
,
which
was
quickly
dubbed
the
``
star
wars
''
program.
sagan
spoke
out
against
the
project
,
arguing
that
it
was
technically
impossible
to
develop
a
system
with
the
level
of
perfection
required
,
and
far
more
expensive
to
build
such
a
system
than
it
would
be
for
an
enemy
to
defeat
it
through
decoys
and
other
means—and
that
its
construction
would
seriously
destabilize
the
``
nuclear
balance
''
between
the
united
states
and
the
soviet
union
,
making
further
progress
toward
nuclear
disarmament
impossible.when
soviet
leader
mikhail
gorbachev
declared
a
unilateral
moratorium
on
the
testing
of
nuclear
weapons
,
which
would
begin
on
august
<integer>
,
<year>—the
<integer>th
anniversary
of
the
atomic
bombing
of
hiroshima—the
reagan
administration
dismissed
the
dramatic
move
as
nothing
more
than
propaganda
and
refused
to
follow
suit.
in
response
,
us
anti-nuclear
and
peace
activists
staged
a
series
of
protest
actions
at
the
nevada
test
site
,
beginning
on
easter
<day>
in
<year>
and
continuing
through
<year>.
hundreds
of
people
in
the
``
nevada

''
group
were
arrested
,
including
sagan
,
who
was
arrested
on
two
separate

was
also
a
vocal
advocate
of
the
controversial
notion
of

,
arguing
in
<year>
that
human
males
could
become
gripped
by
an
``
unusually
severe
[
case

poisoning
''
and
this
could
compel

become
genocidal.
in

review
of

he
argues
that

,
sasha
sagan
argues
in
for

as

that
skepticism
does
not
imply

sagan
was
acquainted
with
the
science
fiction
fandom
through
his
friendship
with
isaac
asimov
,
and
he
spoke
at
the
nebula
awards
ceremony
in
<year>.
asimov
described
sagan
as
one
of
only
two
people
he
ever
met
whose

surpassed

the
other
,
he
claimed
,
was
the

marvin

===
naturalism
===
sagan
wrote
frequently
about
religion
and
the
relationship
between
religion
and
science
,
expressing
his
skepticism
about
the
conventional
conceptualization
of
god
as
a
sapient
being.
for
example
:
some
people
think
god
is
an
outsized
,
light-skinned
male
with
a
long
white
beard
,
sitting
on
a
throne
somewhere
up
there
in
the
sky
,
busily
tallying
the
fall
of
every
sparrow.
others—for
example
baruch
spinoza
and
albert
einstein—considered
god
to
be
essentially
the
sum
total
of
the
physical
laws
which
describe
the
universe.
i
do
not
know
of
any
compelling
evidence
for
anthropomorphic
patriarchs
controlling
human
destiny
from
some
hidden
celestial
vantage
point
,
but
it
would
be
madness
to
deny
the
existence
of
physical
laws.
in
another
description
of
his
view
on
the
concept
of
god
,
sagan
wrote
:
the
idea
that
god
is
an
oversized
white
male
with
a
flowing
beard
who
sits
in
the
sky
and
tallies
the
fall
of
every
sparrow
is
ludicrous.
but
if
by
god
one
means
the
set
of
physical
laws
that
govern
the
universe
,
then
clearly
there
is
such
a
god.
this
god
is
emotionally
unsatisfying
...
it
does
not
make
much
sense
to
pray
to
the
law
of
gravity.
on
atheism
,
sagan
commented
in
<year>
:
an
atheist
is
someone
who
is
certain
that
god
does
not
exist
,
someone
who
has
compelling
evidence
against
the
existence
of
god.
i
know
of
no
such
compelling
evidence.
because
god
can
be
relegated
to
remote
times
and
places
and
to
ultimate
causes
,
we
would
have
to
know
a
great
deal
more
about
the
universe
than
we
do
now
to
be
sure
that
no
such
god
exists.
to
be
certain
of
the
existence
of
god
and
to
be
certain
of
the
nonexistence
of
god
seem
to
me
to
be
the
confident
extremes
in
a
subject
so
riddled
with
doubt
and
uncertainty
as
to
inspire
very
little
confidence
indeed.
sagan
also
commented
on
christianity
and
the
jefferson
bible
,
stating
``
my
long-time
view
about
christianity
is
that
it
represents
an
amalgam
of
two
seemingly
immiscible
parts
,
the
religion
of
jesus
and
the
religion
of
paul.
thomas
jefferson
attempted
to
excise
the
pauline
parts
of
the
new
testament.
there
was
n't
much
left
when
he
was
done
,
but
it
was
an
inspiring
document.
''
regarding
spirituality
and
its
relationship
with
science
,
sagan
stated
:
'spirit
'
comes
from
the
latin
word
'to
breathe'.
what
we
breathe
is
air
,
which
is
certainly
matter
,
however
thin.
despite
usage
to
the
contrary
,
there
is
no
necessary
implication
in
the
word
'spiritual
'
that
we
are
talking
of
anything
other
than
matter
(
including
the
matter
of
which
the
brain
is
made
)
,
or
anything
outside
the
realm
of
science.
on
occasion
,
i
will
feel
free
to
use
the
word.
science
is
not
only
compatible
with
spirituality
;
it
is
a
profound
source
of
spirituality.
when
we
recognize
our
place
in
an
immensity
of
light-years
and
in
the
passage
of
ages
,
when
we
grasp
the
intricacy
,
beauty
,
and
subtlety
of
life
,
then
that
soaring
feeling
,
that
sense
of
elation
and
humility
combined
,
is
surely
spiritual.
an
environmental
appeal
,
``
preserving
and
cherishing
the
earth
''
,
signed
by
sagan
with
other
noted
scientists
in
january
<year>
,
stated
that
``
the
historical
record
makes
clear
that
religious
teaching
,
example
,
and
leadership
are
powerfully
able
to
influence
personal
conduct
and
commitment
...
thus
,
there
is
a
vital
role
for
religion
and
science.
''
in
reply
to
a
question
in
<year>
about
his
religious
beliefs
,
sagan
answered
,
``
i
'm
agnostic.
''
sagan
maintained
that
the
idea
of
a
creator
god
of
the
universe
was
difficult
to
prove
or
disprove
and
that
the
only
conceivable
scientific
discovery
that
could
challenge
it
would
be
an
infinitely
old
universe.
sagan
's
views
on
religion
have
been
interpreted
as
a
form
of
pantheism
comparable
to
einstein
's
belief
in
spinoza
's
god.
his
son
,
dorion
sagan
said
,
``
my
father
believed
in
the
god
of
spinoza
and
einstein
,
god
not
behind
nature
but
as
nature
,
equivalent
to
it.
''
his
last
wife
,
ann
druyan
,
stated
:
when
my
husband
died
,
because
he
was
so
famous
and
known
for
not
being
a
believer
,
many
people
would
come
up
to
me—it
still
sometimes
happens—and
ask
me
if
carl
changed
at
the
end
and
converted
to
a
belief
in
an
afterlife.
they
also
frequently
ask
me
if
i
think
i
will
see
him
again.
carl
faced
his
death
with
unflagging
courage
and
never
sought
refuge
in
illusions.
the
tragedy
was
that
we
knew
we
would
never
see
each
other
again.
i
do
n't
ever
expect
to
be
reunited
with
carl.
in
<year>
,
ann
druyan
edited
sagan
's
<year>
glasgow
gifford
lectures
in
natural
theology
into
a
book
,
the
varieties
of
scientific
experience
:
a
personal
view
of
the
search
for
god
,
in
which
he
elaborates
on
his
views
of
divinity
in
the
natural
world.
sagan
is
also
widely
regarded
as
a
freethinker
or
skeptic
;
one
of
his
most
famous
quotations
,
in
cosmos
,
was
,
``
extraordinary
claims
require
extraordinary
evidence
''
(
called
the
``
sagan
standard
''
by
some
)
.
this
was
based
on
a
nearly
identical
statement
by
fellow
founder
of
the
committee
for
the
scientific
investigation
of
claims
of
the
paranormal
,
marcello
truzzi
,
``
an
extraordinary
claim
requires
extraordinary
proof.
''
this
idea
had
been
earlier
aphorized
in
théodore
flournoy
's
work
from
india
to
the
planet
mars
(
<year>
)
from
a
longer
quote
by
pierre-simon
laplace
(
<integer>–<year>
)
,
a
french
mathematician
and
astronomer
,
as
the
principle
of
laplace
:
``
the
weight
of
the
evidence
should
be
proportioned
to
the
strangeness
of
the
facts.
''
late
in
his
life
,
sagan
's
books
elaborated
on
his
naturalistic
view
of
the
world.
in
the
demon-haunted
world
,
he
presented
tools
for
testing
arguments
and
detecting
fallacious
or
fraudulent
ones
,
essentially
advocating
wide
use
of
critical
thinking
and
the
scientific
method.
the
compilation

on
life
and
death
at
the
brink
of
the
millennium
,
published
in
<year>
after
sagan
's
death
,
contains
essays
written
by
sagan
,
such
as
his
views
on
abortion
,
as
well
as
an
account
by
his
widow
,
ann
druyan
,
of
his
death
in
relation
to
his
having
been
an
agnostic
and
freethinker.
sagan
warned
against
humans
'
tendency
towards
anthropocentrism.
he
was
the
faculty
adviser
for
the
cornell
students
for
the
ethical
treatment
of
animals.
in
the
cosmos
chapter
``
blues
for
a
red
planet
''
,
sagan
wrote
,
``
if
there
is
life
on
mars
,
i
believe
we
should
do
nothing
with
mars.
mars
then
belongs
to
the
martians
,
even
if
the
martians
are
only
microbes.
''
===
marijuana
advocacy
===
sagan
was
a
user
and
advocate
of
marijuana.
under
the
pseudonym
``
mr.
x
''
,
he
contributed
an
essay
about
smoking
cannabis
to
the
<year>
book
marihuana
reconsidered.
the
essay
explained
that
marijuana
use
had
helped
to
inspire
some
of
sagan
's
works
and
enhance
sensual
and
intellectual
experiences.
after
sagan
's
death
,
his
friend
lester
grinspoon
disclosed
this
information
to
sagan
's
biographer
,
keay
davidson.
the
publishing
of
the
biography
,
carl
sagan
:
a
life
,
in
<year>
brought
media
attention
to
this
aspect
of
sagan
's
life.
not
long
after
his
death
,
his
widow
ann
druyan
went
on
to
preside
over
the
board
of
directors
of
the
national
organization
for
the
reform
of
marijuana
laws
(
norml
)
,
a
non-profit
organization
dedicated
to
reforming
cannabis
laws.
===
ufos
===
in
<year>
,
the
year
that
inaugurated
the
``
flying
saucer
''
craze
,
the
young
sagan
suspected
the
``
discs
''
might
be
alien
spaceships.sagan
's
interest
in
ufo
reports
prompted
him
on
august
<integer>
,
<year>
,
to
write
a
letter
to
u.s.
secretary
of
state
dean
acheson
to
ask
how
the
united
states
would
respond
if
flying
saucers
turned
out
to
be
extraterrestrial.
:
<integer>–<integer>
he
later
had
several
conversations
on
the
subject
in
<year>
with
jacques
vallée.
though
quite
skeptical
of
any
extraordinary
answer
to
the
ufo
question
,
sagan
thought
scientists
should
study
the
phenomenon
,
at
least
because
there
was
widespread
public
interest
in
ufo
reports.
stuart
appelle
notes
that
sagan
``
wrote
frequently
on
what
he
perceived
as
the
logical
and
empirical
fallacies
regarding
ufos
and
the
abduction
experience.
sagan
rejected
an
extraterrestrial
explanation
for
the
phenomenon
but
felt
there
were
both
empirical
and
pedagogical
benefits
for
examining
ufo
reports
and
that
the
subject
was
,
therefore
,
a
legitimate
topic
of
study.
''
in
<year>
sagan
was
a
member
of
the
ad
hoc
committee
to
review
project
blue
book
,
the
u.s.
air
force
's
ufo
investigation
project.
the
committee
concluded
blue
book
had
been
lacking
as
a
scientific
study
,
and
recommended
a
university-based
project
to
give
the
ufo
phenomenon
closer
scientific
scrutiny.
the
result
was
the
condon
committee
(
<year>–<integer>
)
,
led
by
physicist
edward
condon
,
and
in
their
final
report
they
formally
concluded
that
ufos
,
regardless
of
what
any
of
them
actually
were
,
did
not
behave
in
a
manner
consistent
with
a
threat
to
national
security.
sociologist
ron
westrum
writes
that
``
the
high
point
of
sagan
's
treatment
of
the
ufo
question
was
the
aaas
'
symposium
in
<year>.
a
wide
range
of
educated
opinions
on
the
subject
were
offered
by
participants
,
including
not
only
proponents
such
as
james
mcdonald
and
j.
allen
hynek
but
also
skeptics
like
astronomers
william
hartmann
and
donald
menzel.
the
roster
of
speakers
was
balanced
,
and
it
is
to
sagan
's
credit
that
this
event
was
presented
in
spite
of
pressure
from
edward
condon.
''
with
physicist
thornton
page
,
sagan
edited
the
lectures
and
discussions
given
at
the
symposium
;
these
were
published
in
<year>
as
ufo
's
:
a
scientific
debate.
some
of
sagan
's
many
books
examine
ufos
(
as
did
one
episode
of
cosmos
)
and
he
claimed
a
religious
undercurrent
to
the
phenomenon.
sagan
again
revealed
his
views
on
interstellar
travel
in
his
<year>
cosmos
series.
in
one
of
his
last
written
works
,
sagan
argued
that
the
chances
of
extraterrestrial
spacecraft
visiting
earth
are
vanishingly
small.
however
,
sagan
did
think
it
plausible
that
cold
war
concerns
contributed
to
governments
misleading
their
citizens
about
ufos
,
and
wrote
that
``
some
ufo
reports
and
analyses
,
and
perhaps
voluminous
files
,
have
been
made
inaccessible
to
the
public
which
pays
the
bills
...
it
's
time
for
the
files
to
be
declassified
and
made
generally
available.
''
he
cautioned
against
jumping
to
conclusions
about
suppressed
ufo
data
and
stressed
that
there
was
no
strong
evidence
that
aliens
were
visiting
the
earth
either
in
the
past
or
present.sagan
briefly
served
as
an
adviser
on
stanley
kubrick
's
film
<year>
:
a
space
odyssey.
:
<integer>
sagan
proposed
that
the
film
suggest
,
rather
than
depict
,
extraterrestrial
superintelligence.
===
``
sagan
's
paradox
''
===
sagan
's
contribution
to
the
<year>
aaas
symposium
was
an
attack
on
the
belief
that
ufos
are
piloted
by
extraterrestrial
beings.
applying
several
logical
assumptions
(
see
drake
equation
)
,
sagan
calculated
the
possible
number
of
advanced
civilizations
capable
of
interstellar
travel
to
be
about
one
million.
he
projected
that
any
civilization
wishing
to
check
on
all
the
others
on
a
regular
basis
of
,
say
,
once
a
year
would
have
to
launch
<integer>
,
<integer>
spacecraft
annually.
not
only
does
that
seem
like
an
unreasonable
number
of
launchings
,
but
it
would
take
all
the
material
in
one
percent
of
the
universe
's
stars
to
produce
all
the
spaceships
needed
for
all
the
civilizations
to
seek
each
other
out.
to
argue
that
the
earth
was
being
chosen
for
regular
visitations
,
sagan
said
,
one
would
have
to
assume
that
the
planet
is
somehow
unique
,
and
that
assumption
``
goes
exactly
against
the
idea
that
there
are
lots
of
civilizations
around.
because
if
there
are
then
our
sort
of
civilization
must
be
pretty
common.
and
if
we
're
not
pretty
common
then
there
are
n't
going
to
be
many
civilizations
advanced
enough
to
send
visitors
''
.
this
argument
,
which
some
called
sagan
's
paradox
,
helped
to
establish
a
new
school
of
thought
,
namely
the
belief
that
extraterrestrial
life
exists
,
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
ufos.
the
new
belief
had
a
salutary
effect
on
ufo
studies.
it
helped
separate
researchers
who
wanted
to
distinguish
ufos
from
those
who
wanted
to
identify
their
pilots
and
it
gave
scientists
opportunities
to
search
the
universe
for
intelligent
life
unencumbered
by
the
stigma
associated
with
ufos.

a

there
he
accepted
a
post
at

in

formed
an

organization
,
the
panhellenic
liberation
movement
(

,
and
toured
the

rallying
opposition
to

despite
his

and
academic
career
in

,
papandreou
held
the
central
intelligence
agency
responsible
for

and
became
increasingly
critical
of

the
fall

he
was
offered
the

which
had
evolved
into

however

he
not

turned
it
down

but
rejected
his
father
's
ideological
heritage
as
a
venizelist
liberal
,
declaring
himself
a
democratic
socialist.
to
that
end
,
he
formed
a

at
the
<year>
elections
,
pasok
won
a
landslide
victory
over
the
conservative
new
democracy
party
,
and
papandreou
became
greece
's
first
socialist
prime
minister.
the
party
's
main
slogan
was
allagí
(
change
)
.
in
office
,
papandreou
backtracked
from
much
of
his
campaign
rhetoric
and
followed
a
more
conventional
approach.
greece
did
not
withdraw
from
nato
,
united
states
troops
and
military
bases
were
not
ordered
out
of
greece
,
and
greek
membership
in
the
european
economic
community
continued
,
largely
because
papandreou
proved
very
capable
of
securing
monetary
aid
for
greece.
in
domestic
affairs
,
papandreou
's
government
immediately
carried
out
a
massive
programme
of
wealth
redistribution
upon
coming
into
office
that
immediately
increased
the
availability
of
entitlement
aid
to
the
unemployed
and
lower
wage
earners.
pensions
,
together
with
average
wages
and
the
minimum
wage
,
were
increased
in
real
terms
,
and
changes
were
made
to
labour
laws
which
up
until
<year>
made
it
difficult
for
employers
to
make
workers
redundant.
the
impact
of
the
pasok
government
's
social
and
economic
policies
was
such
that
it
was
estimated
in
<year>
that
two-thirds
of
the
decrease
in
inequality
that
occurred
in
greece
between
<year>
and
<year>
took
place
between
<year>
and
<year>.during
its
time
in
office
,
papandreou
's
government
carried
through
sweeping
reforms
of
social
policy
by
introducing
a
welfare
state
,
significantly
expanding
welfare
measures
,
expanding
health
care
coverage
(
the
``
national
health
system
''
was
instituted
,
which
made
modern
medical
procedures
available
in
rural

)
promoting
state-subsidized
tourism
(
social
tourism

for
lower-income

,
index-linking
pensions
,
and
funding
social
establishments
for
the

rural
areas
benefited
from
improved
state
services
,
the
rights
and
income
of
low
paid
workers
were
considerably
improved
,
and
refugees
from
the
civil

living
in
exile
were
allowed
to
return
with
impunity.
he
also
officially
recognized
the
role
of
leftist
partisan
groups
in
the
greek
resistance
during
the
axis
occupation.
the
first
law
recognizing
the
greek
resistance
was
passed
in
<year>
excluding
partisan
groups
that
fought
against
the
greek
state
in
the
greek
civil
war
(
a.n.
<integer>
)
in
<year>
his
government
passed
the
<integer>
law
that
abolished
this
exception.a
more
progressive
taxation
scheme
was
introduced
and
budgetary
support
for
artistic
and
cultural
programmes
was
increased.
the
government
also
introduced
a
wage
indexation
system
which
helped
to
close
the
gap
modestly
between
the
highest
and
lowest
paid
workers
,
while
the
share
of
gnp
devoted
to
social
welfare
,
social
insurance
,
and
health
was
significantly
increased.
other
major
policy
changes
included
the
establishment
of
parental
leave
for
both
parents
and
child
care
centres
,
maternity
allowances
,
community
health
centres
,
and
the
encouragement
of
women
to
join
agricultural
cooperatives
as
full
members
,
an
option
which
previously
had
not
been
open
to
women.as
part
of
papandreou
's
``
social
contract
''
,
new
liberalising
laws
were
introduced
which
decriminalised
adultery
,
abolished
(
in
theory
)
the
dowry
system
,
eased
the
process
for
obtaining
a
divorce
,
and
enhanced
the
legal
status
of
women.
in
<year>
,
for
instance
,
women
were
guaranteed
equal
pay
for
equal
work.
papandreou
also
introduced
various
reforms
in
the
administration
and
curriculum
of
the
greek
educational
system
,
allowing
students
to
participate
in
the
election
process
for
their
professors
and
deans
in
the
university
,
and
abolishing
tenure.
the
university
system
was
expanded
,
with
the
number
of
students
doubling
between
<year>
and
<year>
,
while
the
system
was
reorganised
to
provide
the
departments
with
more
power
and
permit
greater
participation
in
their
management.
the
effect
of
these
reforms
was
however
,
limited
by
poor
research
facilities
,
a
shortage
of
qualified
teaching
staff
,
a
lack
of
resources
,
and
often
inefficient
administration.in
a
move
strongly
opposed
by
the
church
of
greece
,
papandreou
introduced
,
for
the
first
time
in
greece
,
the
process
of
civil
marriage.
prior
to
the
institution
of
civil
marriages
in
greece
,
the
only
legally
recognized
marriages
were
those
conducted
in
the
church
of
greece.
couples
seeking
a
civil
marriage
had
to
get
married
outside
greece
,
generally
in
italy.
under
pasok
,
the
greek
state
also
appropriated
real
estate
properties
previously
owned
by
the
church.
a
major
part
of
papandreou
's
allagi
(
``
change
''
)
involved
driving
out
the
``
old
families
''
(
tzákia
,
literally
``
hearths
''
,
using
the
traditional
greek
expression
for
the
genealogy
of
families
)
,
which
dominated
greek
politics
and
economy
and
belonged
to
the
traditional
greek
right.
papandreou
was
comfortably
re-elected
in

<year>
greek
legislative

with
<integer>

and
won
still
further
popularity

greek-turkish
crisis
in
the
aegean

however
,
from
the
summer
of
<year>
,
his
premiership
became
increasingly
clouded
by
controversy
,
as
the
bank

in

he
divorced

==
economic
policies
==
the
expenditure
programme
of
the
papandreou
government
during
<year>–<year>
has
been
described
as
excessive
by
its
conservative
critics.
the
excessive
expenditures
were
not
accompanied
by
corresponding
revenue
increases
and
this
led
to
increases
in
budget
deficits
and
the
public
debt.
many
economic
indicators
worsened
during
<year>–<year>
and
the
economic
policies
of
his
government
were
condemned
as
a
failure
by
his
critics.
various
nationalizations
of
enterprises
and
the
increase
of
the
public
sector
was
another
point
of
critic
by
the
conservatives.
on
the
other
hand
,
according
to
his
supporters
they
were
successful
,
drastically
increasing
the
purchasing
power
of
the
vast
majority
of
greeks
,
with
personal
incomes
growing
by
<integer>
%
in
real
terms
during
the
course
of
the
<year>s.
papandreou
's
increased
spending
in
his
early
years
in
power
(
<year>–<year>
)
was
necessary
in
order
to
heal
the
deep
wounds
of
the
greek
society
,
a
society
that
was
still
deeply
divided
by
the
brutal
memories
of
the
civil
war
and
the
right-wing
repression
that
followed
;
furthermore
,
the
postwar
government
philosophy
of
the
greek
conservatives
simply
saw
the
state
as
a
tool
of
repression
,
with
very
little
money
spent
on
health
or
education.
furthermore
,
papandreou
's
governments
managed
to
handle
the
inflation
and
unemployment
rate
,
maintain
the
growth
of
the
economy
,
while
according
to
his
supporters
the
external
debt
in
<year>
was
in
normal
levels
(
around
<integer>

.
==
international
politics
==
papandreou
was
praised
for
conducting
an
independent
and
multidimensional
foreign
policy
,
and
proved
to
be
a
master
of
the
diplomatic
game
,
thus
increasing
the
importance
of
greece
in
the
international
system.
he
was
co-creator
in
<year>
of
,
and
subsequently
an
active
participant
in
,
a
movement
promoted
by
the
parliamentarians
for
global
action
,
the
initiative
of
the
six
,
which
included
,
besides
the
greek
pm
,
mexico

olof

,
tanzania
's
president
julius
nyerere
and
india
's
prime

indira
gandhi.
the
movement
's
stated
objective
was
the
``
promotion
of
peace
and
progress
for
all
mankind
''
.
after
various
initiatives
,
mostly
directed
at
pressuring
the
united
states
and
the
soviet
union
to
stop
nuclear
testing
and
reduce
the
level
of
nuclear
arms
,
it
eventually
disbanded.papandreou
's
rhetoric
was
at
times
antagonistic
to
the
united
states.
he
was
the
first
western
prime
minister
to
visit
general
wojciech
jaruzelski
in
poland.
according
to
the
foreign
affairs
magazine
papandreou
went
on
record
as
saying
that
since
the
ussr
is
not
a
capitalist
country
``
one
can
not
label
it
an
imperialist
power.
''
according
to
papandreou
,
``
the
soviet
union
represent
[
ed
]
a
factor
that
restrict
[
ed
]
the
expansion
of
capitalism
and
its
imperialistic
aims
''
.
this
antagonistic
stance
made
him
extremely
popular
,
because
the
previous
conservative
governments
were
seen
by
the
greek
people
as
slavishly
loyal
to
us
interests.papandreou
's
government
was
the
first
in
post-war
greece
that
redirected
the
nation
's
defense
policy
to
suit
its
own
security
needs
,
and
not
those
of
the
united
states.
according
to
historian
marion
sarafis
,
from
<year>
until
<year>
,
the
us
had
more
influence
in
greece
's
military
policy
than
the
indigenous
greek
high
command
,
largely
due
to
the
decisive
role
played
by
the
us
in
the
greek
civil
war.papandreou
supported
the
causes
of
various
national
liberation
movements
in
the
world
,
and
agreed
for
greece
to
host
representatives
offices
of
many
such
organisations.
he
also
supported
the
cause
of
palestinian
liberation
,
met
repeatedly
with
plo
chairman
yasser
arafat
and
condemned
israeli
policies
in
the
occupied
territories.
he
was
a
supporter
of
the
two-state
solution
for
the
conflict.
==
papandreou
's
image
and
influence
in
greek
popular
culture
==
among
both
his
supporters
and
his
opponents
,
papandreou
was
referred
to
simply
by
his
first
name
,
``
andreas
''
,
a
unique
situation
in
greek
political
history
,
and
a
testament
to
his
charisma
and
popularity.
andreas
was
also
famous
for
wearing
his
business
suits
with
turtleneck
sweaters
(
ζιβάγκο
in
greek
)
,
instead
of
the
traditional
white
shirt
and
tie
;
he
thus
created
a
huge
fashion
,
mainly
but
not
exclusively
among
his
political
supporters.
his
first
appearance
in
the
greek
parliament
with
a
black
turtleneck
instead
of
shirt
and
tie
caused
a
massive
uproar
in
the
conservative
press
,
who
considered
him
disrespectful
of
parliament
;
however
,
the
whole
issue
only
added
to
his
popularity.
==
legacy
==
papandreou
exercised
a
more
independent
foreign
policy
elevating
greece
's
profile
among
non-aligned
nations.
he
affirmed
greece
's
independence
in
setting
her
own
policy
agenda
,
both
internally
and
externally
,
free
from
any
foreign
domination.
his
opponents
on
the
left
,
on
the
other
hand
,
including
the
communist
party
of
greece
(
kke
)
,
accused
him
of
supporting
,
in
practice
,
the
agenda
of
nato
and
the
united
states.
andreas
papandreou
is
widely
acknowledged
as
having
shifted
political
power
from
the
traditional
conservative
greek
right
,
which
had
dominated
greek
politics
for
decades
,
to
a
more
populist
and
centre-left
locus.
this
included
the
so-called
pariahs
in
politics
as
of
the
end
of
the
greek
civil
war
,
which
were
given
a
chance
to
prove
themselves
in
democratically
elected
governments.
this
shift
in
the
greek
political
landscape
helped
heal
some
of
the
old
civil
war
wounds
;
greece
became
more
pluralistic
,
and
more
in
line
with
the
political
system
of
other
western
european
countries.
papandreou
also
systematically
pursued
inclusionist
politics
which
ended
the
sociopolitical
and
economic
exclusion
of
many
social
classes
in
the
post-civil
war
era.it
is
also
acknowledged
that
papandreou
,
along
with
karamanlis
,
played
a
leading
role
in
establishing
democracy
in
greece
during
metapolitefsi.
he
is
described
as
both
prudent
and
a
realist
,
despite
his
appearance
as
a
leftist
ideologue
,
and
charismatic
orator.
his
choices
to
remain
in
the
european
union
and
nato
,
both
of
which
he
vehemently
opposed
for
many
years
,
proved
his
pragmatic
approach.
even
his
approach
of
negotiating
the
removal
of
the
us
bases
from
greece
was
diplomatic
,
because
although
it
was
agreed
to
remove
them
,
some
of
the
bases
remained.
his
skillful
handling
of
these
difficult
policies
had
the
effect
of
providing
common
policy
goals
to
the
political
forces
of
greece.
complementing
this
political
realism
,
andreas
'
ability
to
publicly
say
no
to
the
americans
gave
greeks
a
sense
of
national
independence
and
psychological
self-worth.
perhaps
his
most
important
achievement
was
the
establishment
of
political
equality
among
greeks
;
during
his
years
in
power
the
defeated
left-wingers
of
the
civil
war
were
no
longer
treated
like
second-class
citizens
and
a
vital
part
of
national
memory
was
reclaimed.papandreou
's
successor
in
office
,
costas
simitis
,
broke
with
a
number
of
papandreou
's
approaches.
papandreou
's
son
,
george
papandreou
,

notable
arguments

===
the
soldier
and
the
state
===
in
the
soldier
and
the
state
:
the
theory
and
politics
of
civil-military
relations
(
<year>
)
huntington
presents
a
general
theory
of
civil–military
relations.
huntington
proposes
a
theory
of
objective
civilian
control
,
according
to
which
the
optimal
means
of
asserting
control
over
the
armed
forces
is
to
professionalize
them.
===
political
order
in
changing
societies
===
during
<year>
,
just
as
the
united
states
'
war
in
vietnam
was
becoming
most
intense
,
huntington
published
political
order
in
changing
societies
,
which
was
a
critique
of
the
modernization
theory
which
had
affected
much
us
policy
regarding
the
developing
world
during
the
prior
decade.
huntington
argues
that
as
societies
modernize
,
they
become
more
complex
and
disordered.
if
the
process
of
social
modernization
that
produces
this
disorder
is
not
matched
by
a
process
of
political
and
institutional
modernization—a
process
which
produces
political
institutions
capable
of
managing
the
stress
of
modernization—the
result
may
be
violence.
during
the
<year>s
,
huntington
was
an
advisor
to
governments
,
both
democratic
and
dictatorial.
during
<year>
,
he
met
with
medici
government
representatives
in
brazil
;
a
year
later
he
published
the
report
``
approaches
to
political
decompression
''
,
warning
against
the
risks
of
a
too-rapid
political
liberalization
,
proposing
gradual
liberalization
,
and
a
strong
party
state
modeled
upon
the
image
of
the
mexican
institutional
revolutionary
party.
after
a
prolonged
transition
,
brazil
became
democratic
during
<year>.
during
the
<year>s
,
he
became
a
valued
adviser
to
the
south
african
regime
,
which
used
his
ideas
on
political
order
to
craft
its
``
total
strategy
''
to
reform
apartheid
and
suppress
growing
resistance.
he
assured
south
africa
's
rulers
that
increasing
the
repressive
power
of
the
state
(
which
at
that
time
included
police
violence
,
detention
without
trial
,
and
torture
)
can
be
necessary
to
effect
reform.
the
reform
process
,
he
told
his
south
african
audience
,
often
requires
``
duplicity
,
deceit
,
faulty
assumptions
and
purposeful
blindness.
''
he
thus
gave
his
imprimatur
to
his
hosts
'
project
of
``
reforming
''
apartheid
rather
than
eliminating
it.huntington
frequently
cited
brazil
as
a
success
,
alluding
to
his
role
in
his
<year>
presidential
address
to
the
american
political
science
association
,
commenting
that
political
science
played
a
modest
role
in
this
process.
critics
,
such
as
british
political
scientist
alan
hooper
,
note
that
contemporary
brazil
has
an
especially
unstable
party
system
,
wherein
the
best
institutionalized
party
,
luiz
inácio

,
emerged
in

===
the
third
wave
===
in
his
<year>
book
the
third
wave
:
democratization
in
the
late
twentieth
century
,
huntington
made
the
argument
that
beginning
with
portugal
's
revolution
during
<year>
,
there
has
been
a
third
wave
of
democratization
which
describes
a
global
trend
which
includes
more
than
<integer>
countries
throughout
europe
,
latin
america
,
asia
,
and
africa
which
have
undergone
some
form
of
democratic
transition.
huntington
won
the
<year>
university
of
louisville
grawemeyer
award
for
this
book.
===
``
the
clash
of
civilizations
''
===
during
<year>
,
huntington
provoked
great
debate
among
international
relations
theorists
with
the
interrogatively
titled
``
the
clash
of
civilizations
?
''
,
an
influential
,
oft-cited
article
published
in
foreign
affairs
magazine.
in
the
article
,
he
argued
that
,
after
the
fall
of
the
soviet
union
,
islam
would
become
the
biggest
obstacle
to
western
domination
of
the
world.
the
west
's
next
big
war
therefore
,
he
said
,
would
inevitably
be
with
islam.
its
description
of
post-cold
war
geopolitics
and
the
``
inevitability
of
instability
''
contrasted
with
the
influential
``
end
of
history
''
thesis
advocated
by
francis
fukuyama.
huntington
expanded
``
the
clash
of
civilizations
?
''
to
book
length
and
published
it
as
the
clash
of
civilizations
and
the
remaking
of
world
order
in
<year>.
the
article
and
the
book
posit
that
post-cold
war
conflict
would
most
frequently
and
violently
occur
because
of
cultural
rather
than
ideological
differences.
that
,
whilst
in
the
cold
war
,
conflict
occurred
between
the
capitalist
west
and
the
communist
bloc
east
,
it
now
was
most
likely
to
occur
between
the
world
's
major
civilizations—identifying
seven
,
and
a
possible
eighth
:
(
i
)
western
,
(
ii
)
latin
american
,
(
iii
)
islamic
,
(
iv
)
sinic
(
chinese
)
,
(
v
)
hindu
,
(
vi
)
orthodox
,
(
vii
)
japanese
,
and
(
viii
)
african.
this
cultural
organization
contrasts
the
contemporary
world
with
the
classical
notion
of
sovereign
states.
to
understand
current
and
future
conflict
,
cultural
rifts
must
be
understood
,
and
culture—rather
than
the
state—must
be
accepted
as
the
reason
for
war.
thus
,
western
nations
will
lose
predominance
if
they
fail
to
recognize
the
irreconcilable
nature
of
cultural
tensions.
huntington
argued
that
this
post-cold
war
shift
in
geopolitical
organization
and
structure
requires
the
west
to
strengthen
itself
culturally
,
by
abandoning
the
imposition
of
its
ideal
of
democratic
universalism
and
its
incessant
military
interventionism.
underscoring
this
point
,
huntington
wrote
in
the
<year>
expansion
,
``
in
the
emerging
world
of
ethnic
conflict
and
civilizational
clash
,
western
belief
in
the
universality
of
western
culture
suffers
three
problems
:
it
is
false
;
it
is
immoral
;
and
it
is
dangerous.
''
the
identification
of
western
civilization
with
western
christianity
(
catholic-protestant
)
was
not
huntington
's
original
idea
,
it
was
rather
the
traditional
western
opinion
and
subdivision
before
the
cold
war
era.
critics
(
for
example
articles
in
le
monde
diplomatique
)
call
the
clash
of
civilizations
and
the
remaking
of
world
order
the
theoretical
legitimization
of
american-caused
western
aggression
against
china
and
the
world
's
islamic
and
orthodox
cultures.
other
critics
argue
that
huntington
's
taxonomy
is
simplistic
and
arbitrary
,
and
does
not
take
account
of
the
internal
dynamics
and
partisan
tensions
within
civilizations.
furthermore
,
critics
argue
that
huntington
neglects
ideological
mobilization
by
elites
and
unfulfilled
socioeconomic
needs
of
the
population
as
the
real
causal
factors
driving
conflict
,
that
he
ignores
conflicts
that
do
not
fit
well
with
the
civilizational
borders
identified
by
him
,
and
they
charge
that
his
new
paradigm
is
nothing
but
realist
thinking
in
which
``
states
''
became
replaced
by
``
civilizations
''
.
huntington
's
influence
upon
us
policy
has
been
likened
to
that
of
historian
arnold
toynbee
's
controversial
religious
theories
about
asian
leaders
during
the
early
twentieth
century.
the
new
york
times
obituary
on
huntington
states
that
his
``
emphasis
on
ancient
religious
empires
,
as
opposed
to
states
or
ethnicities
,
[
as
sources
of
global
conflict
]
gained
...
more
cachet
after
the
sept.
<integer>
attacks.
''
huntington
wrote
that
ukraine
might
divide
along
the
cultural
line
between
the
more
catholic
western
ukraine
and
orthodox
eastern
ukraine
:
while
a
statist
approach
highlights
the
possibility
of
a
russian-ukrainian
war
,
a
civilizational
approach
minimizes
that
and
instead
highlights
the
possibility
of
ukraine
splitting
in
half
,
a
separation
which
cultural
factors
would
lead
one
to
predict
might
be
more
violent
than
that
of
czechoslovakia
but
far
less
bloody
than
that
of
yugoslavia.

asserted
that

segura
also
called

unforgivable
on

huntington
is
credited
with
inventing
the
phrase
davos
man
,
referring
to
global
elites
who
``
have
little
need
for
national
loyalty
,
view
national
boundaries
as
obstacles
that
thankfully
are
vanishing
,
and
see
national

as
residues
from
the
past
whose
only
useful
function
is
to
facilitate

.
the

botha
became
increasingly

on
huntington
's
advice
,
botha
's
government
established
a
powerful
state

apparatus
to
``
protect
''
the
state
against
an
anticipated
upsurge
in
political
violence
that
the

the

controversy
==
in
<year>
,
huntington
was
nominated
for
membership
to
the
national
academy
of

the
nomination
was
opposed
by
serge
lang
,
a
yale
university
mathematician
inspired
by
the
writings
of
mathematician
neal
koblitz
,
who
had
accused
huntington
of
misusing
mathematics
and
engaging
in
pseudo-science.
lang
claimed
that
huntington
distorted
the
historical
record
and
used
pseudo-mathematics
to
make
his
conclusions
seem
convincing.
lang
's
campaign
succeeded
;
huntington
was
twice
nominated

twice
rejected.

<end_of_passage><start_of_passage>james
stemble
duesenberry
(
july
<integer>
,
<year>
–
october
<integer>
,
<year>
)
was
an
american
economist.
he
made
a
significant
contribution
to
the
keynesian
analysis
of
income
and
employment
with
his
<year>
doctoral
thesis
income
,
saving
and
the
theory
of
consumer
behavior.
in
income
,
saving
and
the
theory
of
consumer
behavior
,
duesenberry
questioned
basic
economic
assumptions
about
consumer
behavior.
he
argued
that
consumer
theory
failed
to
take
into
account
the
importance
of
habit
formation
in
establishing
spending
patterns.
he
also
stressed
the
importance
of
social
environment
in
determining
an
individual
's
level
of
expenditures.
he
proposed
a
mechanism
called
the
``
demonstration
effect
''
by
which
people
would
modify
their
consumption
patterns
,
not
because
of
changes
in
income
or
prices
,
but
from
witnessing
the
consumption
expenditures
of
others
that
they
came
into
contact
with.
this
phenomena
,
he
argued
,
was
driven
by
the
interdependence
of
people
's
preferences
and
the
need
to
maintain
or
increase
one
's
social
status
and
prestige.
the
strong
social
component
driving
people
's
consumption
was
a
key
aspect
in
his
formulation
of
a
distinct
theory
of
consumption
called
the
relative
income
hypothesis.
by
this
theory
,
an
individual
's
consumption
and
savings
rate
is
more
dependent
on
their
income
relative
to
those
in
their
community
than
on
their
absolute
level
of
income.
==
reception
==
while
some
contemporaries
of
duesenberry
saw
his
work
as
a
large
contribution
to
the
field
,
it
failed
to
gain
significant
traction.
kenneth
arrow
believed
that
duesenberry
's
work
offered
``
one
of
the
most
significant
contributions
of
the
postwar
period
to
our
understanding
of
economic
behavior
''
.today
,
however
,
the
work
of
duesenberry
is
largely
absent
from
standard
economics
textbooks.
yet
some
,
such
as
robert
h.
frank
,
argue
that
it
outperforms
the
alternative
theories
that
displaced
it
in
the
<year>s
,
such
as
milton
friedman
's
permanent
income
hypothesis.
frank
claims
that
duesenberry
's
theory
can
explain
why
the
rich
tend
to
save
at
higher
rates
than
the
poor.
even
as
national
income
increases
,
the
higher
visible
consumption
of
the
rich
encourages
increased
spending
across
other
income
levels.
additionally
,
duesenberry
's
recognition
of
the
importance
of
habit
formation
aligns
the
observed
short-run
rigidity
of
consumption
,
as
families
attempt
to
maintain
their
previous
standard
of
living
even
during
recessions.

where

==
legacy
==
===
academic
work
===
in
his
first
book
,
the
logic
of
collective
action
:
public
goods
and
the
theory
of
groups
(
<year>
)
,
he
theorized
that
what
stimulates
people
to
act
in
groups
is
incentive
;
members
of
large
groups
do
not
act
in
accordance
with
a
common
interest
unless
motivated
by
personal
gain
(
economic
,
social
,
etc.
)
.
while
small
groups
can
act
on
shared
objectives
,
large
groups
will
not
work
towards
shared
objectives
unless
their
individual
members
are
sufficiently
motivated.in
<year>
,
he
expanded
the
scope
of
his
earlier
work
in
an
attempt
to
explain
the
rise
and
decline
of
nations
(
<year>
)
.
he
argues
that
groups
such
as
cotton
farmers
,
steel
producers
,
and
labor
unions
have
an
incentive
to
form
lobby
groups
and
influence
policies
in
their
favor.
these
policies
will
tend
to
be
protectionist
,
which
will
hurt
economic
growth
;
but
because
the
benefits
of
such
policies
are
concentrated
,
and
their
costs
are
diffused
throughout
the
whole
population
,
there
will
be
little
public
resistance
to
them.
as
distributional
coalitions
accumulate
,
nations
burdened
by
them
will
fall
into
economic
decline.
his
work
influenced
the
formulation
of
the
calmfors–driffill
hypothesis
of
collective
bargaining.in
his
final
book
,
power
and
prosperity
(
<year>
)
,
olson
distinguished
between
the
economic
effects
of
different
types
of
government
,
in
particular
,
tyranny
,
anarchy
,
and
democracy.
olson
argued
that
under
anarchy
,
a
``
roving
bandit
''
only
has
the
incentive
to
steal
and
destroy
,
whilst
a
``
stationary
bandit
''
—a
tyrant—has
an
incentive
to
encourage
some
degree
of
economic
success
as
he
expects
to
remain
in
power
long
enough
to
benefit
from
that
success.

born
in

then
part
of

pavlov
began
his
political
career

later
,
during
the
brezhnev
era
,
he
became
head
of
the
financial
department
of
the
state
planning
committee.
pavlov
was
appointed
to
the
post
of
chairman
of
the
state
committee
on
prices
during
the
gorbachev
era
,
and
later
became
minister
of
finance
in
nikolai
ryzhkov
's
second
government.
he
went
on
to
succeed
ryzhkov
as
head
of
government
in
the
newly
established
post
of
prime
minister
of
the
soviet
union.
as
prime
minister
pavlov
initiated
the
<year>
soviet
monetary
reform
,
commonly
referred
to
as
the
pavlov
reform
,
in
early
<year>.
early
on
he
told
the
media
that
the
reform
was
initiated
to
halt
the
flow
of
soviet
roubles
transported
to
the
soviet
union
from
abroad.
although
ridiculed
at
the
time
,
the
statement
was
later
proven
to
be
true.
in
june
the
same
year
,
pavlov
called
for
a
transfer
of
power
from
the
president
of
the
soviet
union
to
the
prime
minister
and
the
cabinet
of
ministers.
when
that
failed
,
he
joined
a
plot
to
oust
gorbachev.
in
august
,
he
participated
in
the
<year>
soviet
coup
d'état
attempt
,
which
tried
to
prevent
the
disintegration
of
the

pavlov
was
arrested
for
his
involvement
in
the
coup
and
went
on
to
work
in
the
banking
sector
in
post-soviet
russia.
he
is
seen
by
some
as
the
last
legitimate
soviet
head
of
government
since
his
successor
,
ivan
silayev
,
was
appointed
by

russian
soviet
federative

he
held
the
office
as
head
of
the
state
planning
committee
's
finance
department
,
the
department
which
oversaw
all
aspects
of
the
country
's
planned

he
served
as
first
deputy
minister
of
finance
in
boris
gostev
's
ministry
from
january
to
august
<year>.pavlov
was
appointed
chairman
of
the
state
committee
on
prices
on
<day>
,
and
retained
that
post
until
<day>.
throughout
the
period
,
and
later
as
minister
of
finance
,
pavlov
supported
the
centralised
price
reform
proposal
posited
by
nikolai
ryzhkov
,
chairman
of
the
council
of
ministers.
he
succeeded
gostev
to
become
minister
of
finance
in
ryzhkov
's
government
in
<year>
and
his
time
in
the
post
was
considered
uncontroversial
,
even
though
lira
rozenova
,
deputy
chairman
of
the
state
committee
for
prices
,
was
not
elected
to
the
post
of
chairman
of
the
state
committee
for
her
advocacy
of
pavlov-backed
plans
for
centrally
administered
price
reform.
he
was
the
only
minister
in
ryzhkov
's
government

was
also
a
member
of
the
presidium
of
the
council
of
ministers.along
with
eduard
shevardnadze
–
soviet
foreign
minister
–
pavlov
was
the
only
nominee
from
ryzhkov
's
second
government
to
be
overwhelmingly
elected
by
the
supreme
soviet
of
the
soviet
union.
as
minister
of
finance
,
pavlov
was
supportive
of
the
marketisation
of
the
soviet
economy
,
having
overseen
a
rapid
increase
in
the
soviet
money
supply
and
the
increase
in
inflation
it
caused.
pavlov
also
set
the
exchange
rate
for
the
rouble
against
the
american
dollar
on
the
soviet
black
market.
in
<year>
he
proudly
admitted
that
during
his
tenure
as
minister
of
finance
,
and
later
prime
minister
,
he
had
deceived
several
western
banks
and
creditors
by
lying
about
the
soviet
union
's
gold
reserves.
in
<year>
,
pavlov
gathered
together
enough
information
on
the
errors
and
omissions
of
ivan
silayev
,
the
future
soviet
premier
and
russian
sfsr
premier
,
to
weaken
his
position
as
deputy
premier.
silayev
never
forgave
pavlov
and
relations
between
the
two
grew
even
more
icy
when
pavlov
became
soviet
premier.

prime
minister
==
following
the
resignation
of
nikolai
ryzhkov
following
a
heart
attack
in
december
<year>
,
pavlov
was
elected
to
the
new
position
of
prime
minister
as
a
compromise
candidate
,
and
became
chairman
of
the
cabinet
of

he
and
his
two
first
deputy
prime

,
vladimir
velichko

vitaly
doguzhiev

with
<integer>

and
<integer>
abstained
,
while
approval
for
the
majority
of
his
ministers
followed
within
a
few
weeks.
pavlov
was
considered
a
conservative
upon
his
election
as
prime
minister
,
and
the
soviet
press
described
him
as
a
``
bold
and
complex
man
''
who
was
against
full
marketisation
but
who
believed
that
the
soviet
union
was
even
more
oppressive
towards
workers
than
even
the
most
advanced
capitalist
societies.
one
of
his
first
actions
as
prime
minister
was
to
move
the
headquarters
of
the
soviet
government
–
the
cabinet
of
ministers
–
from
the
moscow
kremlin
to
the
former
headquarters

to
strengthen
his
position.

<year>
monetary
reform
===
the
soviet
monetary
reform
of
<year>
,
commonly
referred
to
as
the
pavlov
reform
,
was
the
last
monetary
reform
prior
to
the
dissolution
of
the
soviet

despite
having
made
a
speech
<integer>

saying
there
would

on

,
it
was
intended
to
withdraw
money
from
circulation
for
reallocation
to
the
production
of
consumer
goods
,
which
were
in
short
supply.
in
a
speech
,
pavlov
stated
that
the
reason
for
the
withdrawal
was
the
government
's
belief
that
money
was
being
sent
to
the
soviet
union
from
abroad
,
fuelling
inflation.
although
ridiculed
by
the
soviet
press
at
the
time
,
three
years
later
the
truth
of
pavlov
's
statement
was
verified.
mikhail
gorbachev
then
signed
a
presidential
decree
ordering
the
soviet
financial
system
to
stop
accepting
and
exchanging
banknotes
issued
in
<year>.
the
directive
also
included
<integer>-rouble
and
<integer>-rouble
banknotes
issued
in
<year>.
on
<day>
,
the
government
began
restricting
monthly
bank
deposit
withdrawals
to
<integer>
rubles
with
the
official
explanation
that
this
was
to
freeze
the
income
of
corrupt
officials
,
capitalists
and
criminals.under
the
orders
of
pavlov
,
the
government
freed
forty
percent
of
prices
on
<day>
,
and
introduced
sales
tax
of
<integer>
%
.
prices
of
consumer
goods
,
in
particular
,
were
now
considered
free
in
the
sense
that
negotiation
became
possible
between
producers
and
the
distributor.
according
to
philip
hanson
in
his
book
,
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
soviet
economy
:
an
economic
history
of
the
ussr
from
<year>
,
pavlov
's
reform
was
undermined
by
the
union
republics
who
failed
to
follow
pavlov
's
orders
,
along
with
the
widespread
existence
of
local
monopolies
,
which
tended
to
have
their
own
definition
of
luxury
goods
and
as
a
result
imposed
higher
prices
on
such
items.soviet
citizens
had
only
three
days
from

due
to
this
short

window
,
long

formed
in
front
of
soviet
savings
banks
,
even
though
it
was
also
possible
to
exchange
money
at
workplaces
and
post
offices.
this
reform
also
dealt
a
crippling
blow
to
soviet
citizens
who
had
saved
their
money
and
could
not
move
fast
enough
to

end
the

proved
unsuccessful.
the
government
only
managed
to
withdraw
<integer>

rubles
from
circulation
of
the
country
's
money
supply
against
an
intended
target
of
<decimal>

as
a
result
,
the
pavlov
reform
did
not
put
an
end
to
inflation.
prices
for
items
including
food
and
transport
rose
by
<integer>–<integer>

,
while
the
soviet
standard
of
living
decreased
sharply
and
the
state
budget
deficit
increased
by

in

of

reform
,
inflation
exceeded
the

mark
every

===
coup
attempt
===
in
june
<year>
,
pavlov
,
who
felt
that
the
office
of
prime
minister
had
limited
power
,
discovered
that
gorbachev
planned
to
replace
him
as
prime
minister.
in
response
,
he
arrived
at
the
supreme
soviet
of
the
soviet
union
``
visibly
nervous
''
,
and
in
his
report
to
the
supreme
soviet
,
he
was
forced
to
tell
delegates
of
the
faltering
state
of
the
soviet
economy.
however
,
pavlov
blamed
this
on
the
ongoing
war
of
laws
between
the
supreme
soviet
of
the
soviet
union
and
the
supreme
soviet
of
the
russian
soviet
federative
socialist
republic
(
rsfsr
)
,
which
,
he
argued
,
could
be
resolved
by
introducing
a
state
of
emergency
across
the
entire
soviet
union
,
or
at
least
in
certain
economic
sectors.according
to
pavlov
,
the
union
's
problems
remained
insoluble
as
long
as
gorbachev
retained
so
much
power
and
had
limited
time
to
address
important
issues.
to
break
the
impasse
,
pavlov
called
for
a
transfer
of
power
from
the
president
of
the
soviet
union
to
the
prime
minister
and
the
cabinet
of
ministers
,
(
specifically
,
he
wanted
the
cabinet
to
have
the
right
to
issue
decrees
on
economic
affairs
without
the
approval
of
the
president
)
,
even
creating
a
five-point
resolution
to
that
end
for
the
legislature
to
consider.
pavlov
received
support
for
the
idea
from
the
soyuz
parliamentary
faction
leader
viktor
alksnis
,
who
called
for
an
immediate
vote
on
the
issue.
however
,
several
members
of
soyuz
also
demanded
a
statement
by
the
kgb
and
the
ministry
of
defence
to
comment
on
the
proposal.
in
retrospect
,
alksnis
notes
that
this
resolution
could
have
become
a
coup
d'état
had
pavlov
consulted
with
them
earlier.
according
to
historian
jerry
f.
hough
,
pavlov
's
program
``
was
not
directed
as
much
at
gorbachev
as
at
[
boris
]
yeltsin
''
.by
the
afternoon
,
the
majority
of
soyuz
members
favoured
an
immediate
vote.
the
chairman
of
the
supreme
soviet
of
the
soviet
union
,
anatoly
lukyanov
,
had
already
departed
for
novo
ogarevo
to
take
part
in
constitutional
negotiations
and
he
promised
to
tell
gorbachev
about
the
vote.
in
his
place
stood
ivan
laptev
,
a
pro-gorbachev
reformer
,
who
did
not
trust
lukyanov
and
tried
to
stall
the
vote
by
demanding
a
statement
from
the
kgb
,
ministry
of
the
interior
and
the
ministry
of
defence.
according
to
laptev
,
the
mood
was
such
that
if
a
vote
had
been
taken
pavlov
would
have
won.
at
the
time
,
both
the
soviet
secret
police
and
the
military

was
able
to
increase
the

afterwards
,
jack
matlock
,
united
states
ambassador
to
the
soviet
union
,
told
gorbachev
of
the
possibility
of
a
coup
attempt
against
him
,
and
the
soviet
leader
became
worried
when
anatoly
chernyaev
informed
him
of
mysterious
troop
movements
outside
moscow.
on
<integer>
june
,
four
days
after
pavlov
's
speech
,
gorbachev
addressed
the
supreme
soviet
and
told
delegates
that
there
were
no
differences
in
opinion
between
him
and
pavlov.
even
when
he
had
been
able
to
secure
his
position
,
gorbachev
's
power
within
the
system
was
already
faltering
,
although
he
succeeded
in
getting
the
enhanced
powers
previously
given
to
the
cabinet
of
ministers
reversed.
the
power
struggle
between
gorbachev
and
pavlov
was
not
over
,
with
gorbachev
,
on
july
<integer>
,
<year>
,
promising
yeltsin
and
nursultan
nazarbayev
that
pavlov

along
with
dmitry
yazov
,
minister
of

,
and
vladimir

===
august
coup
===
the
<year>
soviet
coup
d'état
attempt
,
commonly
referred
to
as
the
august
coup
,
was
prompted
by
the
slow
disintegration
of
the
soviet
union
that
resulted
from
gorbachev
's
reform
policy
and
yeltsin
's
drive
towards
an
independent
russia.
the
new
union
treaty
being
prepared
called
for
further
decentralisation
of
power
to
the
republics
,
which
weakened
the
government
's
already
tenuous
hold
on
the
economy.
pavlov
received
a
draft
of
the
new
union
treaty
on
<integer>
august
at
a
security
council
meeting
and
managed
to
get
it
published
in
the
moscow
news
on
<integer>
august.opposing
the
decentralisation
stance
taken
in
the
treaty
,
pavlov
was
one
of
the
key
players
in
the
establishment
of
the
state
committee
for
the
state
of
emergency
in
august
<year>.
pavlov
's
inclusion
in
the
committee
has
been
used
to
demonstrate
its
unwillingness
to
revert
to
pre-gorbachev
policies.
the
committee
's
main
goal
was
to
ensure
that
the
soviet
union
continued
as
a
highly
centralised
union
state.
the
emergency
committee
was
led
by
gennady
yanayev
,
vice
president
of
the
soviet
union
,
interior
minister
boris
pugo
,
defence
minister
dmitry
yazov
and
other
hardliners
who
were
determined
to
take
action
to
oust
gorbachev.vladimir
kryuchkov
,
the
kgb
chairman
,
had
told
pavlov
of
the
coup
on
<integer>
august
,
one
day
before
it
began.
he
was
asked
by
kryuchkov
to
meet
his
co-plotters
at
the
moscow
kremlin
,
where
on
<integer>
august
,
he
and
his
co-conspirators
appeared
on
live
television
and
told
the
soviet
people
that
gorbachev
was
indisposed.
as
the
day
wore
on
it
soon
became
apparent
that
pavlov
had
been
drinking
since
he
issued
several
contradictory
orders
and
repeated
himself.
in
retrospect
he
admitted
that
he
had
been
drinking
with
his
son
the
day
before.
on
the
same
day
,
his
fellow
plotters
decided
to
depose
pavlov
,
sending
him
to
his
dacha
where
his
wife
took
care
of
him.
as
with
all
the
others
,
pavlov
was
arrested
following
the
collapse
of
the
coup.
shortly
after
pavlov
was
hospitalised
with
hypertension
whilst
remaining
in
custody.
he
was
released
on
recognizance
not
to
leave
in
january
<year>
and
granted
amnesty
by
the
russian
state
duma
in
<year>.
==
later
life
and
death
==
after
his
release
from
custody
,
pavlov
became
a
director
of
the
commercial
bank
chasprombank
between
<year>
and
<year>.
he
resigned
at
the
request
of
the
bank
's
board
of
directors
,
who
informed
him
that
they
had
decided
``
to
provide
him
an
indefinite
leave
of
absence.
''
in
february
<year>
,
shortly
after
his
resignation
,
the
bank
's
license
was
revoked
for
violating
the
banking
laws
set
up
by
the
central

of

pavlov
then
worked
as
an
advisor
to

and
in

also

m.
goodwin
(

<integer>
,
<year>
–
august
<integer>
,
<year>
)
was
an
american
mathematician
and
economist.
==
background
==
goodwin
was
born
in
new
castle
,
indiana.
he
received
his
ba
and
phd
at
harvard
and
taught
there
from
<year>
until
<year>.
he
fled
the
united
states
during
the
mccarthy
era
,
then
taught
at
the
university
of
cambridge
until
<year>
and
the
university
of
siena
until
<year>.
although
he
became
a
university
lecturer
in
the
cambridge
faculty
of
economics
and
politics
in
<year>
,
it
was
not
until
five
years
later
that
he
agreed
to
join
the
fellowship
of
a
college
,
choosing
that
of
peterhouse.
christopher
calladine
thinks
that
this
unusual
situation
may
have
been
because
goodwin
initially
had
ideological
opposition
to
the
notion
of
the
college
system
,
which
he
may
have
considered
to
be
anachronistic.
later
,
after
retiring
from
cambridge
,
goodwin
was
the
first
non-italian
professor
of
economics
at
siena.goodwin
described
himself
as
``
a
lifelong
but
wayward
marxist
''
,
joining
the
communist
party
of
great
britain
while
a
rhodes
scholar
at
oxford
in
the
<year>s
and
then
its
american
counterpart
when
he
got
back
to
the
united
states.
however
,
goodwin
left
after
the
announcement
of
the
molotov–ribbentrop
pact.
==
work
==
goodwin
worked
on
the
interaction
between
long
run
growth
and
business
cycles.
his
article
on
matrix
multiplier
was
one
of
the
earliest
uses
of
the
perron–frobenius
theorem
in
economics
,
although
his
reasoning
had
an
error
that
was
diagnosed
by
frank
h.
hahn.
he
returned
to
the
perron–frobenius
theorem
with
his
book
the
dynamics
of
a
capitalist
economy.
goodwin
's
interest
in
applying
the
theory
of
nonlinear
systems
to
macroeconomics
was
sparked
by
philippe
le
corbeiller
,
who
taught
applied
physics
at
harvard.
following
an
early
suggestion
of
le
corbeiller
's
,
goodwin
characterized
the
business
cycle
as
a
non-linear
self-oscillation.
goodwin
credited
le
corbeiller
with
teaching
him
nonlinear
dynamics
while
le
corbeiller
credited
goodwin
with
the
discovery
of
the
two-stroke
oscillator.goodwin
adopted
the
lotka–volterra
equations
for
the
population
dynamics
of
a
predator
and
a
prey
species
as
the
basis
of
the
goodwin
model
(
or
goodwin
's
class
struggle
model
)
of
economic
growth.
in
his
model
,
employed
workers
have
the
role
of
predators
as
their
wage
demands
squeeze
profits
and
hence
investment
,
causing
a
subsequent
increase
in
unemployment.
another
model
,
goodwin
's
non-linear
accelerator
,
is
also
a
model
of
endogenous
cycles
in
economic
activity
in
which
the
cycles
do
not
rely
on
outside
shocks
or
structurally
unstable
parameters.
``
a
growth
cycle
''
(
<year>
)
saw
goodwin
utilise
volterra
's
equations
to
formalise
karl
marx
's
theory
of
economic
cycles.
